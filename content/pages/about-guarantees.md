    worked hard to maintain our commitment to design, construction, quality and
    customer service. The 25 Year Structural Guarantee is specific to the
    initial purchaser and is transferable to new owners of the home if they
    agree into the maintenance plan.


    1. **All our decks come with a 25 year warranty!***

    2. **Patios roofs come with a 15 year structural warranty backed by
    Stratco**

    3. **12 Month Deck Check**

    4. **The Tidy Builders. **


    We provide a free maintenance check, 12 months after completion we return to
    inspect your project to ensure your investment stands the test of time.


    During the construction process we keep your property clean and tidy to
    ensure you, your family, and the Deking team are kept safe. On completion we
    remove all our building waste and leave your property tidy
