      We use Deking Decks for our custom built Heisig Homes. We highly recommend
      Deking Decks and look forward to a very long working relationship with
      them.

      From the day of the quote through to the building of our deck the service
      has been friendly and very professional. Our builder was here every day
      early and worked hard. He was friendly and discussed any queries I had.
      Before he left each day he left a clean work site. I thoroughly recommend
      DekingDecks and wouldn't hesitate to use them again.

      Excellent job, started and completed when they said.

      That in itself is a minor miracle compared with all the other trades I
      have had to deal with over the past 5 months whilst doing a major house
      renovation.

      I highly recommend them.

      what was happening and the deck looks amazing.

      Hi Brett, thank you. I did make you think out of the box, you listened to
      what I wanted and came up with it and in budget. Ben did a wonderful job
      building the Orchid Lath (bush House). He left everything clean and now I
      have a Lath which is everything I wanted. Thank you Deking a job well done
