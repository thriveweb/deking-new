      Our Single Skin Patio Roofs (Non-Insulated) offer a versatile and
      budget-friendly option for extending your outdoor living area. These roofs
      provide shelter from the elements, making your patio usable in various
      weather conditions, without the added cost of insulation.




      Single Skin Patio Roofs are roofing structures attached to your home that
      provide a protective covering for your outdoor space. Unlike their
      insulated counterparts, these roofs do not feature additional layers for
      temperature regulation (‘Single Skin’ refers to the fact that they just
      have one layer of material). They are a straightforward solution to
      enhance your outdoor area's functionality and aesthetic appeal.




      These simple, functional roofs are the classic and timeless patio cover
      option, perfect for people who are more concerned with cost effectiveness
      and ease of installation than insulation or luxury. The typical design is
      in a V-line form, but you can also have a flat roof - the customisation
      options allow beautiful integration with your home.

    podsTitle: What is a Single Skin Roof?
  - podDescription: >-
      Cost-Effective: Single Skin Patio Roofs are an affordable option for
      expanding your outdoor living space without breaking the bank.


      Weather Protection: Enjoy your patio year-round, shielded from the sun,
      rain, and other outdoor elements.


      Natural Light: These roofs allow ample natural light, maintaining a bright
      and inviting atmosphere in your outdoor area. You may even choose to add
      transparent panels, acting as a sky light. 


      Customisation: Tailor the design, colour, and style to match your home's
      existing architecture and aesthetics.


      Quick Installation: Deking Decks ensures a hassle-free and efficient
      installation process to minimise disruptions to your daily life.

    podsTitle: Key Benefits of Single Skin Patio Roofs (Non-Insulated)
  - podDescription: >-
      Because the Single Skin roof type is much lighter than a heavier,
      insulated option, it is much easier to install and requires less support.
      This makes it far more cost effective, especially if the roof has to span
      a large area, as a heavy roof will require more labour and materials. 


      And, with our 15 year warranty, you can’t go wrong with a Single Skin
      Roof. 




      ## Flexible Design Choices


      Our Single Skin Patio Roofs come in various designs and styles, ensuring
      you can find the perfect fit for your outdoor space. Whether you prefer a
      flat roof, pitched roof, gable, or a combination of these styles, we have
      the expertise to bring your vision to life. Choose from a range of colours
      and materials to match your home's exterior.
