  Pool decks are a great way to add space to a pool area, a place to relax on
  lounge chairs, a way to access all sides of the pool, or a connection to the
  house for an extended feel. By adding change of heights in the deck, a new
  area is created which adds more interest and is more visually appealing along
  with the ability to have different areas to lounge about or entertain on. With
  matching materials a pool house can be added for shade or for a bbq area

      The deck is going to get wet with the family splashing around and it’s
      especially important if you have a salt water pool.  All framing timbers
      and fixings need to be able to withstand this harsh environment, which is
      why we only use H3 treated pine for the frame and stainless steel fixings
      within the splash zone. This includes the decking screws, concrete anchors
      into the pool shell, and joist hangers. Stirrups are heavy duty and hot
      dipped galvanised which are set into 20 Mpa poured concrete

  - description: >-
      We can build pool decking on all kinds of blocks including those with
      unusual elevations/slopes and interesting pool designs. By incorporating
      different deck levels you can create a unique and beautiful entertaining
      space. The design of your pool deck can make a huge difference to the
      atmosphere of your pool.

      Hardwood decking boards are predominantly used for their ability to handle
      the splashing and pool chemicals. Another option is a composite decking
      board which requires no ongoing maintenance. Pine decking is not advised
      for a pool deck as it is prone to cracking and splitting. New products are
      coming to the market every year so call us to find a solution for your
      decking needs

      Timber Pool Decking looks great and will last a life time when properly
      designed and built to exacting standards. Special considerations need to
      be addressed at the design stage to ensure a quality finish is achieved
      for now and into the future. The frame of the deck has to be made of
      treated pine with a minimum H3 treatment, a steel frame will not last
      around a pool with the salt or chlorine corroding the metals within 5 or
      so years, no where near close to Deking’s 25 year warranty. Stainless
      steel fasteners must be used within the splash zone of the pool for the
      above mentioned reason, this includes the decking screws.

bannerDescription: >
  Yes, you can build a deck around an above ground pool. Pool decking provides a
  great place to play for your family, friends and guests. Pool decking can be
  constructed to extend over the edge of the pool for a totally seamless in
  ground look or finish under the pool capping edge for possible future liner
  replacement ease.
