  Pool decks are a great way to create additional space to the pool area.  The
  deck can add a relaxing place for lounge chairs, create a safe accessible area
  to all sides of the pool, and offer a seamless connection to the entrance of
  the home. 


  Using height and level changes in the deck creates other areas, this adds more
  interest, is visually attractive and gives the ability to create different
  zones for lounging and entertaining. 


  The addition of a pool house in similar materials will create a lovely shady
  area and BBQ zone.


  DeKing Decks can help you create the perfect custom made deck for your new
  pool, or the deck can be built while the pool is being constructed, or
  overhaul and revamp your existing pool area with a new deck.


  We can also complete the pool deck with ranges of fencing materials that meet
  all certification regulations.


  ##  Important things to consider when it comes to pool decking

      The deck is going to get wet with the family splashing around and it’s
      especially important if you have a salt water pool.  All framing timbers
      and fixings need to be able to withstand this harsh environment, which is
      why we only use H3 treated pine for the frame and stainless steel fixings
      within the splash zone. This includes the decking screws, concrete anchors
      into the pool shell, and joist hangers. Stirrups are heavy duty and hot
      dipped galvanised which are set into 20 Mpa poured concrete

      We can build pool decking on all kinds of blocks including those with
      unusual elevations/slopes and interesting pool designs. By incorporating
      different deck levels you can create a unique and beautiful entertaining
      space. The design of your pool deck can make a huge difference to the
      atmosphere of your pool.

      Hardwood decking boards are predominantly used for their ability to handle
      the splashing and pool chemicals. Another option is a composite decking
      board which requires no ongoing maintenance. Pine decking is not advised
      for a pool deck as it is prone to cracking and splitting. New products are
      coming to the market every year so call us to find a solution for your
      decking needs

      Pool decks are most commonly used for sunbathing or outdoor entertaining
      with family and friends. Let's face it, who doesn't love soaking up the
      beautiful Queensland rays and enjoying quality time with the people you
      love, a beer or wine and a good BBQ.  But pool decks can be used for so
      many other purposes as well.


      It might be your quiet escape where you can read your favourite book while
      listening to the lapping water and the song birds.


      It could be your gardening oasis, with beautiful flowers alongside the
      deck with lovely fragrances all year round, attracting the native birds
      and butterflies to your pool area.


      The pool deck might be your creative zone in the home, for writing that
      next book, painting your next masterpiece or crafting to your hearts
      content.  


      Whatever you use your pool deck for, Deking Decks can build you a
      magnificent pool deck to suit your needs which is not only strong and safe
      but will last for years to come.  Check out our 25 year warranty

    podsTitle: What will you use your pool deck for?
  - podDescription: >-
      Timber Pool Decking looks great and will last a life time when properly
      designed and built to exacting standards. Special considerations need to
      be addressed at the design stage to ensure a quality finish is achieved
      for now and into the future. 


      The frame of the deck has to be made of treated pine with a minimum H3
      treatment, a steel frame will not last around a pool with the salt or
      chlorine corroding the metals within 5 or so years, no where near close to
      Deking’s 25 year warranty. 


      Stainless steel fasteners must be used within the splash zone of the pool
      for the above mentioned reason, this includes the decking screws.

bannerDescription: >
  Yes, you can build a deck around an above ground pool. 


  Pool decking provides a great place to play for your family, friends and
  guests. Having a deck around an above ground pool links the outside area to
  the pool itself, the kids can run and dive, or bomb dive siblings ... things
  that are not normally possible with an above ground pool. Parents can sunbathe
  on the decking or sit comfortably and keep watch over the kids and clearly see
  the entire pool, which is not always possible sitting on the outside of an
  above ground pool.


  The pool decking can be constructed to extend over the edge of the pool for a
  totally seamless in ground look or finish under the pool capping edge for
  possible future liner replacement ease.
