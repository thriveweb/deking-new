  What are some important things to consider when it comes to pool decking?
  Timber Pool Decking looks great and can last a long time if you look after it.
  For some people sanding and oiling their deck gives them great pride and it is
  a relaxing way to spend a weekend. For others the thought may put you off
  entirely. You can always get someone else to do it for you. It’s also
  important to make sure you have waterproof, rust proof screws and nails. The
  deck is going to get wet with the family splashing around. It’s especially
  important if you have a salt water pool.  Can I build a deck around an above
  ground pool? Yes, you can build a deck around above ground and in ground
  pools. Pool decking provides a great place to relax for your family, friends
  and guests. Pool decking can be constructed to extend over the edge of the
  pool for a totally seamless look and feel or finish flush with your pool
  copping edge.  Pool decking for Sloping blocks or unusual pool designs We can
  build pool decking on all kinds of blocks including those with unusual
  elevations/slopes and interesting pool designs. By incorporating different
  deck levels you can create a unique and beautiful entertaining space. The
  design of your pool deck can make a huge difference to the atmosphere of your
  pool.
