  Pool decks are a great way to add space to a pool area, a place to relax on
  lounge chairs, a way to access all sides of the pool, or a connection to the
  house for an extended feel. By adding change of heights in the deck, a new
  area is created which adds more interest and is more visually appealing along
  with the ability to have different areas to lounge about or entertain on. With
  matching materials a pool house can be added for shade or for a bbq area

      Timber Pool Decking looks great and can last a long time if you look after
      it. For some people sanding and oiling their deck gives them great pride
      and it is a relaxing way to spend a weekend. For others the thought may
      put you off entirely. You can always get someone else to do it for you.
      It’s also important to make sure you have waterproof, rust proof screws
      and nails. The deck is going to get wet with the family splashing around.
      It’s especially important if you have a salt water pool. Can I build a
      deck around an above ground pool? Yes, you can build a deck around above
      ground and in ground pools. Pool decking provides a great place to relax
      for your family, friends and guests. Pool decking can be constructed to
      extend over the edge of the pool for a totally seamless look and feel or
      finish flush with your pool copping edge. Pool decking for Sloping blocks

      Timber Pool Decking looks great and will last a life time when properly
      designed and built to exacting standards. Special considerations need to
      be addressed at the design stage to ensure a quality finish is achieved
      for now and into the future. The frame of the deck has to be made of
      treated pine with a minimum H3 treatment, a steel frame will not last
      around a pool with the salt or chlorine corroding the metals within 5 or
      so years, no where near close to Deking’s 25 year warranty. Stainless
      steel fasteners must be used within the splash zone of the pool for the
      above mentioned reason, this includes the decking screws.
