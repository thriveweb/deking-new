  For customers looking for a great addition to the outdoor space on their
  property, a custom gazebo from DeKing can be the perfect option.   DeKing has
  access to an array of different materials for your build. Although most
  gazebos utilise timber for decking and structural support, we will be happy to
  advise you on other materials. Your gazebo roofing is also very important to
  the design and function of the project. Our roofing options can provide
  protection from the elements while matching the design and flow of your
  current home. A wide selection of colours helps improve the aesthetic appeal
  of your gazebo. High quality brands such as COLORBOND steel provide
  exceptional durability and performance

  - podDescription: >-
      A sheltered area within your swimming pool area is a must in the
      Queensland climate, not only for the hot summer days but for the drenching
      night storms.


      Deking can design and build your pool house to fit in with your pool area,
      taking cues from your home and existing landscaping to create a real oasis
      feel


      Materials and finishes can also include a rendered wall, plantation
      shutters to block westerly sun, and bench seating with a integrated daybed
      to laze the day away

      Do you love where you live but just need some extra space for all of
      lifeâ€™s stuff?


      Maybe enclosing your existing deck with solid walls and roofing then
      adding a new deck is a simple solution to make room for the new media room
      or kids bedroom


      DeKing can work off your set of plans or have these designed for you, also
      taking care of any engineering and organising the certification permit so
      you can relax without any hassles.
