      DeKing has access to an array of different materials for your build.
      Although most gazebos utilise timber for decking and structural support,
      we will be happy to advise you on other materials. If you do choose a
      timber material, our experts can discuss the best types of timber to use.
      Based on your application and budgetary restraints, selecting the right
      type of wood makes a big difference.




      Our most popular timber decking options are standard pine, treated
      cypress, Merbau and Kwila. Although Merbau and Kwila are both imported
      hardwoods, they differ in various ways. Merbau presents top-of-the-line
      density and durability with a red-brown colouration, but Kwila can be an
      excellent option for situations that call for strong stability and a
      lighter pale brown colouration. Standard pine and treated cypress are used
      in more budget-conscious projects and offer good value overall.




      Your gazebo roofing is also very important to the design and function of
      the project. Our roofing options can provide protection from the elements
      while matching the design and flow of your current home. A wide selection
      of colours helps improve the aesthetic appeal of your gazebo. High quality
      brands such as COLORBOND steel provide exceptional durability and
      performance.
