      DeKing has access to an array of different materials for your build.
      Although most gazebos utilise timber for decking and structural support,
      we will be happy to advise you on other materials. If you do choose a
      timber material, our experts can discuss the best types of timber to use.
      Based on your application and budgetary restraints, selecting the right
      type of wood makes a big difference.




      Our most popular timber decking options are standard pine, treated
      cypress, Merbau and Kwila. Although Merbau and Kwila are both imported
      hardwoods, they differ in various ways. Merbau presents top-of-the-line
      density and durability with a red-brown colouration, but Kwila can be an
      excellent option for situations that call for strong stability and a
      lighter pale brown colouration. Standard pine and treated cypress are used
      in more budget-conscious projects and offer good value overall.




      Your gazebo roofing is also very important to the design and function of
      the project. Our roofing options can provide protection from the elements
      while matching the design and flow of your current home. A wide selection
      of colours helps improve the aesthetic appeal of your gazebo. High quality
      brands such as COLORBOND steel provide exceptional durability and
      performance.

      From the first time you call DeKing, we promise that your experience is
      nothing but great. You can simply give us a call or email and an
      experienced professional will come to your property at your own
      convenience to discuss your dreams, share ideas, make measurements and
      show you examples of our previous gazebo projects.




      After discussing and understanding your vision of the perfect gazebo, we
      will work to find all the right materials and confirm with you on
      selection and price. Our staff will gladly help you make any changes or
      adjustments to make your gazebo dreams come true. Once we’ve confirmed the
      project, feel free to sit back and enjoy the excitement as we prepare. We
      will make sure that all the necessary permits and insurances are in place
      while we order the materials for your gazebo.




      Throughout the actual building process, we strive to ensure the safety of
      your family and friends. Your property will be kept clean and organised
      throughout construction. You will also receive progress reports as we move
      along to keep your excitement going strong. After your gazebo has been
      completed, all waste material will be removed and one of our professionals
      will inspect the project with you to ensure your satisfaction.
