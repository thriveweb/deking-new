      EKODEKING offers an array of excellent composite eco decking materials to
      meet all of our customers’ needs. Although these materials present the
      same look and texture as real timber materials, they are constructed from
      recycled wood and plastic. Some of our clients even believe that the
      composite materials feel better on the feet than real timber.


      The composite material option is not only eco-friendly, but it is also
      extremely durable and requires almost zero maintenance. We source our eco
      decking materials from a variety of different suppliers such as Trex,
      TimberTech, ZHU, EZY Decking, and more.


      All our composite decking is "capped" to all sides to ensure a minimum 25
      year warranty

      eco-friendly, you should consider DeKings’s responsibly sourced timber

      harvesting. All of our Australian Hardwoods and Treated Pine materials are
      sourced from sustainable forests and woodlands. Get the benefits of real
      timber without harming the environment with responsibly sourced timber

      At EKODEKING, we strive to go above and beyond in our commitment to eco
      decking and good environmental practices. Our EKODEKING Replant Programme
      plants one tree for every 20 square meters of decking built. Each tree is
      planted on the spot of your choice as the customer. We also go the extra
      mile by limiting and recycling waste during the construction process. At
      our office, we conserve the environment through the use of recycled office
      products and energy-efficient appliances.

      DeKing understands the responsibility behind its character as being a
      reputable builder. As a proud member of the wider community, DeKing not
      only considers the investment value and quality of a deck build, but also
      the environmental impact of the everyday deck-building project. We work
      with our clients to design custom decking options that flow with the rest
      of the property and add beauty to its outdoor spaces while delivering
      actual environmental alternatives to our customers. Not only can our decks
      increase your overall property value and allow you to enjoy a more
      relaxing lifestyle, but this can occur in a way that limits the
      environmental impact of the build.
