  As our name suggests DeKing Decks are well known for constructing beautiful
  decks.  What you may not know, we are also experts in home extensions and room
  additions.


  With growing families and extended families, increasing the size of your home
  or the addition of rooms is quite often a better alternative than selling your
  home and purchasing a larger home somewhere else.  You already know and love
  the neighbourhood, the kids are all in schools and may have to change if you
  move elsewhere, and this isn't just a house it's your home.  So if you can
  make it bigger to accommodate your needs, why wouldn't you?

      The team of professionals at DeKing Decks can add most room types or
      extend existing rooms, with the exception of kitchens and bathrooms. 
      Common room additions or extensions are: bedrooms, family or living rooms,
      theatre or media rooms, home offices and dining rooms.  We can also create
      the perfect escape room by adding a man-cave/she-shed, crafting room,
      music room or studio office in your yard!


      DeKing's team are experienced and fully qualified builders. We prefer to
      focus on smaller jobs and customised work, rather than large extensions
      and new home builds.  There are not that many builders specialise in this
      niche market. If you are thinking of adding another room to your home or
      extending the living space get in contact with us, we would love to help
      you make those dreams a reality.

      ## Extensions to the back of the home


      The majority of houses lean to adding rooms and extending to the rear of
      the house. This is usually the most economical and easiest way to proceed,
      as there is more space at the back to utilise. If there is room to extend
      or add to the side or front of the home we can certainly assist.


      Several factors can affect the price and complexity of the build. The
      current home layout, the number, type and size of additional rooms,
      materials to be used, and structural changes required to the existing
      build to allow for the extension or additional rooms to be constructed.


      If you are considering a home extension or the addition of one or more
      rooms to your house we would love to assist you and talk about your plans
      and ideas. Contact us by phone 1800 335 464 or complete an online enquiry
      form. DeKing Decks service greater Brisbane, Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast
      areas and we would be thrilled to get your dream home extensions and room
      additions underway.

      ## Room Additions and Extensions


      Outgrowing the family home is a common occurrence. The common way to deal
      with this is sell your home and buy a bigger home elsewhere.  But if you
      have room to expand, adding additional rooms and extending the current
      space could be the prefect solution, without the hassle of selling and
      moving.


      Additional bedrooms are often required for numerous reasons: 


      * as the kids grow up, toddlers sharing a room works but teenagers sharing
      a room not so much!

      * a pregnancy (planned or not) will mean the addition of another room for
      the babies when they arrive.

      * it is becoming more common these days to have aging parent/s come and
      live at home rather than go into a nursing home as they get older.

      ## Extra Living Areas


      Adding another living area is also on trend: 


      * a parents retreat

      * a play area for the kids or 

      * a teenage retreat. 

      * grandparents living area

      * a formal theatre or media room

      * a formal dining area as well as a casual area


      Extensions and alterations are also very common:


      * increase the size of the current lounge room

      * remove a wall to make three small bedrooms into two large bedrooms

      * change the layout of the home to make it flow better and add more space


      The team of professionals at DeKing are the ideal match to take on your
      house extensions and/or room additions. As we are also deck experts you
      may want to create some additional outdoor room with the addition of a
      deck for outdoor entertaining as well. We are blessed with the perfect
      Queensland climate to enjoy indoor/outdoor living all year.
