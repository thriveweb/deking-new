      An insulated flyover roof is a modern design concept that elevates your
      patio area by creating a roofing structure that extends from your home,
      providing more space, headroom, and aesthetic appeal.


      ‘Flyover’ refers to the way this patio roof design overlaps the roof of
      the house, attaching to the walls but sitting above the roof structure,
      meaning it can be even higher than the ceilings in your house. This offers
      the aesthetic appeal of a higher ceiling, plus better ventilation, meaning
      a more comfortable outdoor area for hot Brisbane summer days. It also
      remains waterproof, so it’s usable during both hot and rainy weather. And,
      because it’s insulated, there is even more usability every day of the year
      - yes, even on rare freezing Queensland winter days. 


      This modern design is highly customisable and creates a sense of luxury
      and elegance in any home. Insulation can make even the loudest
      neighbourhood more bearable, creating a garden oasis with reduced noise
      levels. And the flyover appeal, paired with a ceiling that seamlessly
      blends from the inside to the outside of your home, can make even a small
      house seem far bigger and more upscale. 


      It’s clear why this is becoming an incredibly popular option for
      homeowners.

      There are two methods of creating the lift above the house roof, with both
      systems fully engineered to meet Australian standards and cyclonic
      conditions:


      1. Extenda brackets or SHS posts. These protrude through the roof surface
      and are attached to the house framework. Rubber Dektite flashings are then
      installed for a 100% water seal.

      2. Fascia riser bracket. This method does not penetrate the roof surface
      but is instead fixed to the side of the house roof rafter and protrudes
      through the fascia, just under the gutter.
