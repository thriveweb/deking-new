  Welcome to the DeKing Decks online shop. Here you can purchase one of our do
  it yourself (DIY) Kitset decking kits. At present we have 2 DIY kits to choose
  from: the ‘DIY Deck’ or ‘Deck In A Day’. Click on one of the decking kits
  listed below to get more detailed information in the ‘Product Description’
  section about the size of each deck and what come as part of the kit.  Make
  sure you choose the right deck kit for your needs and that you have all the
  necessary tools and skills to be able to put the deck together properly. The
  DIY Deck is for a larger area (at 5m x 4m) and the Deck In A Day is for a
  smaller area (3m x 1.5m).  Of course, if you need a bigger or more complex
  deck built, contact us—we’re the experts in building timber decks and can
  custom design a deck to perfectly suit your needs. If you have any questions
  about our products or services, please call us on 1800 335 464.
