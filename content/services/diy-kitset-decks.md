excerpt: Build a Patio Roof or  Deck in a Day and Create More Space for Your Family?
welcomeTitle: Missing the Great Australian Outdoors! Now that you are isolating?
welcomeDescription: >-
  Most of us in Australia would love a deck with roof.


  A place to relax - with both sun and shade options.  Even if we don't have a
  pool. The grass is great but there are green ants! and it's not flat enough
  for drinks. 


  But who usually has time to build a deck or patio roof? 


  That's why at DeKing Decks we usually build decks and roofs for our clients.
  But times have changed. While we are still building decks and roofs there are
  also many people deciding to build their own. 


  ## DIY Deck and Patio Roof Kit Options


  **1. 5m x 4m DIY Deck**


  **2. 3m x 1.5m Deck in A Day**


  **3. Kitset Patio Roof**


  Our **5m x 4m DIY Deck** may be the perfect solution for you. It’s a quality
  product that is very reasonably priced and gives the luxury of a deck without
  a major renovation. 


  Our** Deck In A Day (3m x 1.5m)** might be a great option for you if you’re on
  a tight budget and want a deck built quickly. It’s a high-quality product
  that’s very affordable. It allows you to extend an area of your house and get
  the benefits of a deck without needing a major renovation.

  All kits come with necessary materials to help you put together the deck
  properly. Make sure you have all the necessary tools to build it.

  x1.5m will be less.
