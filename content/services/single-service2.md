      The popular new look in patio roofs is the insulated flyover roof. A
      flyover roof gives you extra headroom, a sense of open space, and the
      modern finish that your new home deserves.  Patio Roofing Brisbane
      Installation  The clean, smooth ceiling looks more like a living room roof
      than a patio roof, blurring the distinction between an indoor and outdoor
      living space. The special channels within the insulated panels can easily
      hide all the electrical wiring needed to fit downlights and ceiling fans.
      All the accessories, including the gutter, will be made to match your
      home’s design to make it look like a natural extension. Stratco insulated
      Cooldek panels come in 3 different thicknesses, making them suited to
      small areas as well as large spans. Thicknesses include:  50mm 75mm 100mm.
      Roofing options also include corrugated, to match your house roof, or the
      classic style for a minimal pitch design.

    podsTitle: What will you do under your Patio Roof?
  - podDescription: >-
      The flyover or raised patio roof is by far the most popular patio roof
      being built today. With the advantage of the extra ceiling height which
      matches the height inside your home along with the added benefit of cross
      ventilation and a reduction in heat transfer to the space below.


      There are 2 methods of creating the lift above the house roof, with both
      systems fully engineered to meet Australian standards and cyclonic
      conditions.


      1. Extenda brackets or SHS posts. These protrude through the roof surface
      and are attached to the house framework. Rubber dektite flashings are then
      installed for a 100% water seal 

      2. Fascia riser bracket. This method does not penetrate the roof surface
      but is instead fixed to the side of the house roof rafter and protrudes
      through the fascia, just under the gutter.

      Timber patios are a way of life in Queensland. You may remember the famous
      GANGgajang song, "Sounds Of Then", that captured the essence of life on a
      patio so perfectly. As the song goes, ‘Out on the patio we sit / and the
      humidity we breathe / we’d watch the lightning crack over canefields /
      laugh and think, this is Australia’. It’s practically in our blood—no
      wonder we love patios so much!  


      Timber patios provide much more than just a great view. They’re also the
      perfect way to extend your living area, create that outdoor entertainment
      space you’ve always wanted, or compliment a pool.  So if you’re looking
      for a timber patio to refresh, revive, and revolutionise your current
      living space, get in touch with us at DeKing. We can design and build the
      perfect patio for you!
