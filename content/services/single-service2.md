      The popular new look in patio roofs is the insulated flyover roof. A
      flyover roof gives you extra headroom, a sense of open space, and the
      modern finish that your new home deserves.  Patio Roofing Brisbane
      Installation  The clean, smooth ceiling looks more like a living room roof
      than a patio roof, blurring the distinction between an indoor and outdoor
      living space. The special channels within the insulated panels can easily
      hide all the electrical wiring needed to fit downlights and ceiling fans.
      All the accessories, including the gutter, will be made to match your
      home’s design to make it look like a natural extension. Stratco insulated
      Cooldek panels come in 3 different thicknesses, making them suited to
      small areas as well as large spans. Thicknesses include:  50mm 75mm 100mm.
      Roofing options also include corrugated, to match your house roof, or the
      classic style for a minimal pitch design.

      Timber patios are a way of life in Queensland. You may remember the famous
      GANGgajang song, Sounds Of Then, that captured the essence of life on a
      patio so perfectly. As the song goes, ‘Out on the patio we sit / and the
      humidity we breathe / we’d watch the lightning crack over canefields /
      laugh and think, this is Australia’. It’s practically in our blood—no
      wonder we love patios so much!  But timber patios provide much more than
      just a great view. They’re also the perfect way to extend your living
      area, create that outdoor entertainment space you’ve always wanted, or
      compliment a pool.  So if you’re looking for a timber patio to refresh,
      revive, and revolutionise your current living space, get in touch with us
      at DeKing Decks. We can design and build the perfect patio deck for you!
