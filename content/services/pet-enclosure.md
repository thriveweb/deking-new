      There are many reasons why pet owners choose to build enclosures. Some of
      the benefits of having an enclosure include:


      **1. Safety: **


      A dog or cat enclosure allows your pet to enjoy the outdoors without the
      risks associated with roaming freely. This can include being taken to the
      pound, exposure to traffic, other animals, and diseases.


      **2. Exercise: **


      A cat enclosure provides a safe space for your cat to run, jump, and play,
      which is great for their physical health and mental stimulation. Depending
      on the size of the enclosure and the size of the dog they may be able to
      exercise too. Especially if you have a long deck or verandah that will be
      enclosed.


      **3. Fresh Air and Sunshine: **


      Just like humans, dogs and cats need fresh air and sunshine to stay
      healthy. A pet enclosure allows your cat or dog to enjoy the outdoors
      while staying safe and protected.


      **4. Reduced Scratching: **


      A dog or cat enclosure can help reduce destructive scratching behaviour
      inside your home.
