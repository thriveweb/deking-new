  Elevate Your Outdoor Experience with Attached Insulated Patio Roofs by Deking
  Decks in Brisbane
welcomeDescription: >-
  Ready to transform your outdoor space into a haven of comfort and style? Look
  no further than Deking Decks. We're your reliable partner in creating
  remarkable Attached Insulated Patio Roofs in Brisbane. Our team of experts
  excels at turning ordinary outdoor areas into extraordinary havens of
  relaxation and elegance.


  An attached insulated patio roof is a cutting-edge design concept that
  seamlessly extends your living area to the outdoors. This roofing structure is
  expertly attached to your home, offering a functional and visually stunning
  transition between indoor and outdoor spaces. With a focus on both aesthetics
  and utility, these roofs redefine the way you experience your outdoor living.




  An ‘attached’ patio roof refers to the way it attaches directly to your roof
  on 1-3 sides, giving it an extra sturdy foundation and blending it seamlessly
  with your existing roof. ‘Insulated’ refers to the clever technology of the
  roof itself, which helps to keep your patio cool in summer, warm in winter,
  dry on rainy days, and even reduce noise pollution. 




  The insulated roofing sheets come in two roofing profiles: Classic (Trim deck)
  and Corrugated, with a range of colours to choose from to match your home.
  Three thicknesses - 50mm, 75mm, and 100mm - allow for spans from 5100mm to
  7200mm without the need for additional beams. The ceiling is available with a
  smooth white finish to best match the ceiling inside your home.

      Most new patio installations now feature an insulated panel that consists
      of two skins of metal, one for the roof and one for the ceiling, which are
      separated by an insulating substance such as polystyrene or foam. This is
      often referred to as a “sandwich” panel. The foam used in insulated
      roofing is similar to that used for cool-rooms at your shopping centre or
      your esky at home. This significantly reduces the transference of direct
      heat through the roof sheeting.


      Whilst Single Skin roofs are still effective and attractive, for the small
      increase in investment most people would find value in the presence of
      insulated panel especially in the hot Brisbane sun.


      ## Why Choose an Attached Insulated Patio Roof?


      * **Expanded Living Area:** Enjoy additional usable space for various
      activities, from hosting gatherings to enjoying outdoor leisure.
