      The addition of bench seating maximizes your deck space and with the
      option of opening lids, you can hide all the kids toys or pool equipment.
      Seating is typically made of the same materials as the deck to make it
      blend in. Lids have hidden handles for ease of lifting and to not obstruct
      the seating position

      Privacy screens are a way to give you and your neighbour the ability to
      relax and entertain on your deck without prying eyes, or maybe its just to
      hide a bad view. Privacy screens are generally made of the matching
      decking timbers ie Merbau hardwood, or powdercoated aluminum. The best
      part of aluminium screens are that you never have to maintain them, apart
      from an annual hose off if they become dusty. You have the option of
      positioning the slat horizontally or vertically depending on your taste
      and circumstances

      Glass pool fencing offers an unrestricted view of your area while
      maintaining a safe zone


      Stainless steel spigots are either core drilled into the concrete floor or
      surface attached to the deck. 12mm toughened glass which exceeds
      Australian standards and self closing gates to comply with pool safety
      regulations


      The glass can be pre primed with a special coating prior to installation
      to make cleaning a very rare event.


      Glass balustrades add a touch of class to any deck, verandah, or balcony.
      The clean lines make for a very contemporary look. Stainless spigots
      attached to the deck surface with a handrail of either merbau 90x42mm or
      stainless steel.
