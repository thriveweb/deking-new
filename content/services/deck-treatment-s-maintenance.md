welcomeTitle: Why oil my deck?
welcomeDescription: >-
  All decks and outdoor timbers require maintenance. The amount of maintenance
  is specific to your deck, ie. How much sun, rain, pool splashing affects your
  deck. As a rule of thumb uncovered decks need an oiling treatment every year,
  covered decks will be safe for a coating every second year

      At Deking we only recommend acrylic for a number of reasons; 

      1. Environmentally friendly 
      2. Ease of use 
      3. More extensive colour range 
      4. Quicker drying time 
      5. Clean up is a breeze 
      6. Last up to 3-5 times of a conventional oils 
      7. 12 month guarantee. 

      We follow the Intergrain 3 step process for deck treatments which includes

      1. Powerprep to remove any remaining tannin stains
      2. Reviva to clean and brighten the timbers
      3. 3 coats of Ultradeck with the final coat being anti slip when requested

  - podDescription: >-
      If your deck needs a freshen up or a complete overhaul we can help. From a
      complete sand, back to bare timber to remove flaking and previous failed
      coatings to just an annual treatment to keep it at its best.


      The first sign that your deck needs an oiling treatment is to check if
      water beads, splash a little water on your deck and if it soaks in, give
      us a call!


      We can advise on the best finishes including anti slip coatings for pool
      surrounds and entrance ways
