  At Deking we only recommend acrylic for a number of reasons;  1  
  Environmentally friendly  2   Ease of use  3   More extensive colour range 4  
  Quicker drying time  5   Clean up is a breeze  6   Last up to 3-5 times of a
  conventional oils  7   12 month guarantee  Next you will need to prepare the
  decking boards with an oxalic cleaner, the Flood Company has a product called
  WoodPrep, Intergrains version is called Reviva. You will need to wet your
  wooden deck with a garden hose and apply the product as per the manufacturers
  instructions, wait the recommended time and rinse off with a pressure washer.
  To test if this process has worked, sprinkle water on the decking timbers and
  if the water absorbs into the timber you are ready for the next step, if the
  water beeds off you will need to repeat this process.  Spa-N-Deck by The Flood
  Company or Ultradeck by Intergrain can now be applied as per the instructions
  on the tin.  Watch this video for more information on the best times of the
  year to do various stages of deck maintenance
