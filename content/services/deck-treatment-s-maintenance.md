welcomeTitle: Why oil my deck?
welcomeDescription: >-
  All decks and outdoor timbers require maintenance. The amount of maintenance
  is specific to your deck, ie. How much sun, rain, pool splashing affects your
  deck. As a rule of thumb uncovered decks need an oiling treatment every year,
  covered decks will be safe for a coating every second year

      At Deking we only recommend acrylic for a number of reasons; 1
      Environmentally friendly 2 Ease of use 3 More extensive colour range 4
      Quicker drying time 5 Clean up is a breeze 6 Last up to 3-5 times of a
      conventional oils 7 12 month guarantee Next you will need to prepare the
      decking boards with an oxalic cleaner, the Flood Company has a product
      called WoodPrep, Intergrains version is called Reviva. You will need to
      wet your wooden deck with a garden hose and apply the product as per the
      manufacturers instructions, wait the recommended time and rinse off with a
      pressure washer. To test if this process has worked, sprinkle water on the
      decking timbers and if the water absorbs into the timber you are ready for
      the next step, if the water beeds off you will need to repeat this
      process. Spa-N-Deck by The Flood Company or Ultradeck by Intergrain can
      now be applied as per the instructions on the tin. Watch this video for
      more information on the best times of the year to do various stages of
      deck maintenance
