welcomeDescription: "DeKing are well known for constructing stunning decks, but did you know that we also build additional rooms (and extensions) to your home.  We can add bedrooms, living and family rooms, media and theatre rooms, dining rooms and home offices.  DeKing can build most room additions or extensions with the exception of kitchens and bathrooms.  We can even construct that man-cave, she-shed, craft or office studio in your backyard!\r\n\nThe team at DeKing are fully qualified and experienced builders that specialise primarily in decks and room additions.  We do not build entire houses or take on large extensions as we prefer to focus on the smaller and customised work.  This specialised work will extend your outdoor and indoor living areas and add enjoyment to your current home.  So if you are looking to add one or more rooms to your home we are best equipped to help, as there are not many builders that focus on smaller, more specific builds and room additions.\r\n\n## Back Home Extensions\r\n\nThe majority of room additions are extensions to the rear of existing homes. The way the majority of homes are constructed means it is the easiest and most cost efficient way to go, but occasionally we do build rooms to the front or the side of homes.  \r\n\nThe complexity and the cost of back home extensions varies significantly from home to home and is dependent upon several factors - current layout of the house, the size, type and number of room additions, the chosen materials and the changes required to the existing home to accommodate the additional back of house extension.\r\n\n## Popular Room Additions\r\n\nFamilies often outgrow their existing homes as their family grows.  A three bedroom home might be just what is needed when the children are smaller, but as they become teenagers sharing a bedroom often becomes problematic.  Or there might be an unexpected pregnancy and a new addition to the family.  These are very common reasons why we are engaged to add one or more additional bedrooms to a home.\r\n\nThe increased popularity of media and theatre rooms has led to a number of room addition building jobs at Deking.  The preference for more than one living area, many home owners choose now to have a formal as well a casual living area, or an adult zone and a kids zone.  \r\n\nAs DeKing are both room and deck builders, we are the perfect choice to undertake your rear home extension to include that extra living area and deck addition. We have the perfect climate in South East Queensland to enjoy indoor and outdoor living all year round."
