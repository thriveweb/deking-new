    podsTitle: What will you use your timber deck for?
  - podDescription: >-
      DeKing provides a wide array of timber decking materials to build the deck
      or patio of your dreams. Each of our materials performs well in different
      situations. Your decision should depend on your application and your own
      unique style. Our most popular products are Merbau (Intsia bijuga),
      sometimes known as Kwila. It offers a reeded underside with a very smooth
      top side and a great density rating to prevent termites. Many of our
      timber decking clients love Merbau for its deep red-brown colour and even
      finish.


      Brisbane residents who live in a Queenslander style home prefer the look
      of Spotted Gum or some type of Australian Mixed species. This type of
      decking is more rustic with natural gum lines for character.

      Dekings decks are backed with a 25 year warranty, so to maintain this
      standard there are a lot of things that go on above, and below the decking
      surface.


      A good deck has to start with a good foundation, following through a
      strong frame and finished with finely finished laid decking


      All our decks are pictured framed to protect the ends of the decking
      boards, with a decking board fascia to cover the deck frame. Corners are
      beautifully mitred by the craftsmanship or our carpenters.

    podsTitle: What makes a Deking Deck so special?
  - podDescription: >-
      Be it a small entranceway that needs a Wow statement to building on the
      side of a cliff, we at Deking can accommodate your needs.


      Our timber decking solutions can be built over existing concrete or tiles
      within an alfresco area to difficult sloping sites that requires large
      footings and special engineering design.


      We're only too happy to work with you to create something that is unique,
      functional, and provides real value to your property.
