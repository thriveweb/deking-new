  DeKing offers a variety of different timber decking applications. We build
  high-quality commercial and residential decks for outdoor kitchens, patios and
  pergolas. From second-story patios to large covered outdoor kitchens, DeKing
  meets any need for timber decking. Our clients enjoy the quality workmanship
  and customised design process during construction.  Pool decking represents a
  big headache for many people in the Brisbane and coastal areas. In many cases,
  pool decks fail from exposure to constant moisture and pool chemicals. Getting
  the right timber decking from DeKing around your pool makes a huge difference.
  Timber pool decking offers a great look and can last for a long period of time
  if it is maintained properly.  While some of our customers enjoy oiling and
  sanding their timber decking, others despise the thought of working on the
  deck. If you donâ€™t want to spend any time maintaining your timber pool deck,
  DeKing can recommend some service companies to help you maintain your deck. We
  also ensure that only water and rustproof screws will be used during
  construction. Timber pool decking can be done for unusual pool layouts,
  sloping blocks and above ground pools. DeKing can build a timber deck around
  your pool from scratch, or replace an old deck with a brand new timber pool
  deck.

    podsTitle: What will you use your timber deck for?
  - podDescription: >-
      DeKing provides a wide array of timber decking materials to build the deck
      or patio of your dreams. Each of our materials performs well in different
      situations. Your decision should depend on your application and your own
      unique style. Our most popular products are Merbau (Intsia bijuga),
      sometimes known as Kwila. It offers a reeded underside with a very smooth
      top side and a great density rating to prevent termites. Many of our
      timber decking clients love Merbau for its deep red-brown colour and even
      finish.


      Brisbane residents who live in a Queenslander style home prefer the look
      of Spotted Gum or some type of Australian Mixed species. This type of
      decking is more rustic with natural gum lines for character.

      Dekings decks are backed with a 25 year warranty, so to maintain this
      standard there are a lot of things that go on above, and below the decking
      surface.


      A good deck has to start with a good foundation, following through a
      strong frame and finished with finely finished laid decking


      All our decks are pictured framed to protect the ends of the decking
      boards, with a decking board fascia to cover the deck frame. Corners are
      beautifully mitred by the craftsmanship or our carpenters.
