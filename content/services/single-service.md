  DeKing offers a variety of different timber decking applications. We build
  high-quality commercial and residential decks for outdoor kitchens, patios and
  pergolas. From second-story patios to large covered outdoor kitchens, DeKing
  meets any need for timber decking. Our clients enjoy the quality workmanship
  and customised design process during construction.  Pool decking represents a
  big headache for many people in the Brisbane and coastal areas. In many cases,
  pool decks fail from exposure to constant moisture and pool chemicals. Getting
  the right timber decking from DeKing around your pool makes a huge difference.
  Timber pool decking offers a great look and can last for a long period of time
  if it is maintained properly.  While some of our customers enjoy oiling and
  sanding their timber decking, others despise the thought of working on the
  deck. If you don’t want to spend any time maintaining your timber pool deck,
  DeKing can recommend some service companies to help you maintain your deck. We
  also ensure that only water and rustproof screws will be used during
  construction. Timber pool decking can be done for unusual pool layouts,
  sloping blocks and above ground pools. DeKing can build a timber deck around
  your pool from scratch, or replace an old deck with a brand new timber pool
  deck.

      DeKing provides a wide array of timber decking materials to build the deck
      or patio of your dreams. Each of our materials performs well in different
      situations. Your decision should depend on your application and your own
      unique style. Our most popular products are Merbau and Kwila.  Merbau
      Merbau is an imported hardwood from Indonesia. It offers a reeded top
      surface and a great density rating of 850. It performs well in many
      applications due to its density, toughness and durability. Many of our
      timber decking customers love Merbau for its deep red-brown colour.  Kwila
      Kwila provides an excellent alternative to pine for timber decking.
      Brisbane residents rely on the stability and durability of Kwila for their
      decks and patios. This hardwood originates in Papua New Guinea and comes
      in board lengths of 1.8 meters to 5.4 meters. Kwila also offers a variety
      of different colours from pale brown to dark red-brown.  Treated cypress
      pine or standard pine For customers on a limited budget, DeKing is happy
      to provide treated cypress pine or standard pine. Although most pine
      products suffer from some disadvantages, they make good timber decking due
      to their affordability, availability and longevity. Just watch out for
      treated pine products in applications that cannot handle chemicals. The
      chemicals in treated pine can slowly leak into the surrounding area if the
      decking is not well maintained.  Size and Building options DeKing offers
      an assortment of different size options for all materials. A standard
      board width of 90mm is the most common, but we provide boards up to 140mm
      wide when needed. Our timber decking solutions can be built over existing
      concrete or tiles.
