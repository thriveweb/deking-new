## Summer is almost here ...

Summer is fast approaching. We have already seen the SE Queensland temperatures rise above 30 degrees in September. It is going to be another long, hot summer and that means one thing - we will be spending a lot more time entertaining outside to make the most of those evening breezes and the perfect Queensland climate we live in.

How is your outdoor entertainment area looking?  Are you ready for Summer? Or does your outdoor area need some love and attention and a much needed makeover to create the perfect entertainer zone?

What makes an amazing outdoor BBQ area?

If you already have a deck (or you are considering building one) then you should think seriously about what you will use this outdoor area for. Living in Queensland we have the perfect weather all year round for outside entertaining. It would be a wasted deck opportunity if you did not incorporate a BBQ area into your deck plans.

## What do you plan to use the entertaining area for?

This might seem a simple question, but there are many different uses for an outdoor entertainment area. Informal after work meetings, catch ups with family and friends





## Some things to consider when planning your outdoor entertainment area:



* Aspect - does the entertainment area face to the east or the west? If it does there will be times during the day where sun will flood this area. Shade cloths and roller blinds may be useful to block out the majority of the sun in the morning or late afternoon.
* Wind and rain direction - if your deck is located in a position where you may suffer with directional rain and strong winds then you may want to look at transparent screens to protect against the unpleasant weather conditions. 
* Floor surface - concrete or decking on the floor will give you a flat and level surface. The area will be safer, and it will also be easier to maintain the floor and keep it tidy and clean.
* Spacing - consider the layout of furniture in the area and also the direction of smoke if cooking. You want to have enough space to safely walk around the area and not have flammable furniture located next to the BBQ.
* Access to the home - convenient access from outside to inside is important. It will make entertaining simple as it will be easy and fast to bring food and utensils out, and dirty dishes in when finished entertaining. 
* Ambience - Design the entertainment deck to include planter boxes, lighting, seating and privacy screens. This all adds to the ambience of the entertainment area to set the mood.
* Furniture - a dining setting is a must for entertaining, but did you want formal or casual? You could also consider adding some couches to create a separate zone to socialise and relax with company after the meal.
