DeKing Decks offer a wide range of decking alternatives to create the pool and spa deck of your dreams. By selecting the right materials for your spa deck, you will end up with a long-lasting and durable deck which is a great investment.

## Why get in a professional?

The block slope, changes in elevation, available space, aspect of pool/spa and who the users will be can all affect the deck options.  If you have multiple factors listed above (eg. unusual block shape, steep slope and elevation changes) then it is worth hiring a professional deck builder to custom design the perfect deck for your pool and spa area. The specialist builders at DeKing Decks have a wealth of experience in the design of pool and spa decks which enrich and enhance the water deck area.

Many of the custom deck jobs include elevation changes.  These decks have been specifically designed to flow with the pool and/or spa already there.

DeKing Decks can also extend the deck over the water to create an elegant, flowing look.  Or the deck can be finished flush with the copping spa edge.

## Additions to the standard spa deck

There are many options that can be added to a deck to finish it off how you want it.

## Seating

The addition of built-in seating into the deck design is very practical and useful.  Outdoor furniture will quickly deteriorate and weather if not under a covered area.  Building the seating into the deck design overcomes this and provides a long lasting seating alternative.

## Lighting

You can create an amazing atmosphere by adding low voltage deck lights.  The built-in deck lighting around the pool or spa area creates that wow factor.  The deck lighting also extends the use of the spa or pool into the evening, and not restricted to just daylight hours.  If you don't have lighting in the spa or pool, then definitely consider deck lighting.

## Planters

Adding greenery around the pool and spa area can make the entire area more appealing and visually attractive.  The inclusion of built-in planters to the deck deigns allows you to add plants to the area without the need of bulky pots.  For a tropical feel add palms, or for a low maintenance garden try succulents.

## Attractive railings

Pool railings are compulsory, but you don't want to ruin the look of your deck by adding the wrong railings after the build.  The railings can make or break the atmosphere of the pool/spa deck.

Glass balustrades with stainless steel or timber handrails are popular for railings as the glass does not impede the view, but there are plenty of options to choose from.

## Covered seating area

The addition of a seating area that is covered will provide the homeowner with an extended living area beside the water.  It makes an awesome space for entertaining.  The covered area will also protect you and your outdoor furniture from the harsh UV rays and storms.
