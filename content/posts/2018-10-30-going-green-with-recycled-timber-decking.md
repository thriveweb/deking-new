DeKing decking takes pride in serving the Brisbane community with high quality timber decking services. To help you lessen your impact on the environment, DeKing now provides recycled timber decking options. [EKODEKING](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/eco-decking/), a division of DeKing, offers high-quality environmentally friendly decking services through recycled and composite decking materials. DeKing believes that you should be able to enjoy your property and the great outdoors without causing harm to the environment.

## Recycled Timber and Composite Decking

For those looking for affordable eco-friendly decking, composite and recycled timber decking materials from DeKing are an excellent option. Recycled decking boards are typically milled from timber sourced from older building demolitions. Over many years, these timber products have become very stable and offer a great material option for decking. DeKing can provide almost any size and style of recycled timber decking board material.

The composite decking materials at DeKing are very popular in the Brisbane area. They provide the ultimate eco-friendly decking option. Composite materials often look and feel better than real timber, but are really manufactured from recycled plastic and timber. Decks built with these composite materials are extremely durable and require very little maintenance. DeKing sources these materials from a variety of different eco-focused suppliers.

## Other Eco-Friendly Decking Options

EKODEKING also provides an array of other decking and sustainability services to protect our environment. As a proud supporter of Sustainable Forest Management, DeKing and EKODEKING ensure that the forests of Australia are harvested in a responsible manner. After each harvest, new trees are planted.Â  EKODEKING obtains its hardwoods and treated pine from sustainable sources only.

Although responsibly sourced timber is a great start, EKODEKING believes that it can do more to reduce our impact on the environment. The EKODEKING Replant Program is an initiative developed by DeKing that involves the planting of trees for every custom deck sold. For every 20 square meters of decking provided, DeKing plants one tree. This tree will be planted on your property in a spot designated by you!

Recycled timber decking and the many other options provided by DeKing and its EKODEKING division show that we are committed to sustaining our beautiful environment. As one of the top deck builders in Brisbane and along the Gold and Sunshine coasts, DeKing takes responsibility for the sustainability of the community.
