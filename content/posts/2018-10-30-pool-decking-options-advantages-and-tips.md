[Pool decking](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/pool-decking/) if done right can substantially increase the aesthetic look of your pool increasing your enjoyment of sunny days spent around the pool.

It is more cost effective and practical to have your pool and or pool and spa built first before your pool deck is constructed. It is possible to do it the other way around but is not ideal.

If you are reading this article, you are probably already considering timber decking around your pool, however in case you have missed a few we have listed some of the advantages of pool decking below.

## Advantages of Pool Decking

* Wooden decks are more flexible than paved or concrete pool surrounds and is thus more child friendly in the event of a fall.
* A well designed timber pool deck will take into account the pool surrounds and ensure that you deck compliments the environment leaving you with a natural extension to your back garden.
* If you have the space, a pool deck can provide an area for sitting, reclining or entertaining and somewhere comfortable to watch the children while they are swimming.
* A really great pool deck can include a shaded/roofed area nearby the pool for sun protection and further enjoyment of the outdoors lifestyle.
* If the shape of your pool allows, with a timber pool deck you could also have a wooden bridge built over the pool.
* The colour and warmth of a pool deck complements and adds to the blue hues of your pool or pool and spa enhancing the appeal of the entire outdoor area.
* The gaps between boards on your timber pool deck allow for drainage of water, protecting your deck boards by ensuring that puddles don’t form and reducing the slipping hazard created by water puddles.
* A pool deck helps keep your pool clean as you substantially reduce the amount of dirt and grass you transfer from your feet into the pool.
* A good quality pool deck can also increase the value of your home when it comes time for you to sell your property.

## Pool Decking Materials

It is extremely important that the right materials are used for your pool project – materials that are durable, attractive and not too hard on your pocket. The timber used for your pool deck need to be properly prepared so as to avoid any peeling and blistering that could occur in the future. Pool decking boards should be treated and coated before they are laid otherwise it is not possible to ensure that the boards are completely coated.

If you use the right materials and hire skilled pool decking builders you should obtain a deck that you can be proud of, and most importantly will last. When considering which materials should be used for your pool decking and the design of your deck, you need to keep the following in mind:-

**Your Pool Deck Should Be:**

* Non-slippery, even when wet.
* Comfortable for barefoot use.
* Able to withstand heat and resist absorption of that heat so the deck does not become too hot to stand on.
* Long lasting and blend into the surrounding landscape.
* Safe and functional.
* Treated and sealed properly so as to ensure that chlorine spills don’t bleach your deck.
* Built using stainless steel nails or screws to prevent rust from forming.
* Built to Australian Standards and include an approved pool fencing and gate with correct child safety latch.

## Pool Decking Design

Every pool is different and you need to ensure that you obtain the right pool deck design for your pool that will ensure that it is functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. Design challenges for pool decks can include sloping blocks and unusual pool shapes.

**Timber Pool Decking Maintenance**

There is no doubt that timber pool decking can look really great. However to keep it looking this way there is some maintenance involved such as regularly oiling the deck. You do need to look after your timber pool decking to ensure its longevity and reliability.

**Pool Decking Warning**

Many people think that by laying the decking boards upside down (ridged side up) they are creating a better non-slip surface. However it is strongly recommended that you don’t fall into this trap. When a deck is constructed using boards upside down it does in fact become more slippery as algae grows in the water trapped between the grooves. This then becomes a safety hazard and also means that you deck can be susceptible to rot as the water cannot escape and the boards don’t dry out as quickly.
