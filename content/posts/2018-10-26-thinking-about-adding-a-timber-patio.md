Timber patios are a way of life in Queensland. You may remember the famous GANGgajang song, _Sounds Of Then_, that captured the essence of life on a patio so perfectly. As the song goes, _‘Out on the patio we sit / and the humidity we breathe / we’d watch the lightning crack over canefields / laugh and think, this is Australia’_. It’s practically in our blood—no wonder we love patios so much!

But [timber patios](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/timber-decks/) provide much more than just a great view. They’re also the perfect way to extend your living area, create that outdoor entertainment space you’ve always wanted, or compliment a pool.

So if you’re looking for a timber patio to refresh, revive, and revolutionise your current living space, get in touch with us at DeKing Decks. We can design and build the perfect patio deck for you!

## What is a Timber Patio?

A timber patio is simply an outdoor extension of your home made from wood. It’s a very good investment, and something that you, your family and friends can enjoy in the years to come.

## What Type of Timber Patios do we Build?

At DeKing Decks, we pride ourselves on our high-quality timber patios and our ability to design and build one to suit almost any purpose. For example, we can build patios for:

* living spaces
* outdoor kitchens
* entertainment areas
* a second story
* pergolas
* verandahs
* pools.

We’ve been designing and building [residentia](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/timber-decks/)l and [commercial](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/commercial-decking/) patio decks for more than 14 years, with countless happy clients.

## What Kind of Timber do we use on Patios?

We have a range of high-quality timbers that we’ve chosen to suit Queensland’s weather conditions.

So depending what colour and style of timber patio you want, we have the timber products to meet your needs.

Most of our clients choose either Merbau or Kwila timber. However, if you have a smaller budget, we also have treated cypress pine and standard pine available.

Or, if you’re looking for inspiration, check out our [image gallery](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/projects/) for timber patio ideas.

We are a business who likes to consult with our clients, and our main goal is to make sure you are happy with the final product. So we’ll work with you from the ideas and concept stage, to design, and right through to construction to make sure that, together, we bring your dream patio to life.

## Patio design and privacy

When thinking about your patio design, always keep privacy and noise in mind. What’s the use of having a patio if noise from your neighbourhood always disturbs your own private moments?

To help protect your privacy, a patio can include features that provide a boundary between you and your neighbours. These features can include café blinds or pull down roller blinds, fences, plants, rendered walls and privacy screens.
