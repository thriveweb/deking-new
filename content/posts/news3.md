## Benefits of Insulated Patio Roofing

There are many benefits to insulated patio roofing, but, let’s face it, most of them have to do with combating Queensland’s harsh climate and extreme weather conditions—allowing you to get the most out of your patio space.

**The benefits include:
**

* keeping you cool and comfortable outdoors all year round (especially summer)
* reducing the noise from rain, making it easier to hear conversations
* cooling the interior of your house
* reducing your energy costs and carbon footprint
* increasing the value of your house.
* Our insulated patio roofs are also low-maintenance and strong.

## Insulated Flyover Roof

A very popular choice for insulated patio roofing these days is the ‘flyover’ roof style.

An insulated flyover roof gives you extra headroom and that ‘open-air’ feeling to your outdoor living space. It’s also designed to easily accommodate electrical wiring, downlights and ceiling fans, etc.
