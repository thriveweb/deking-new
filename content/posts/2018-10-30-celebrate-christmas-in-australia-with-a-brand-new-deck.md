Is there any better way to celebrate Christmas in Australia than with a brand new deck? Especially in South East Queensland where summer temperatures and humidity can soar—sending family and friends outside in search of a cool breeze or a pool to dip their feet in.

If you’re planning on a big family Christmas this year with all the trimmings, a brand new deck from DeKing Decks will set the scene perfectly. You can sip beer or champagne while you recline on a big comfy couch. Or unwrap some presents as someone fires up the outdoor BBQ. Any great Christmas celebration in Australia needs a deck.

## Why get a New Deck for Christmas?

A quality wooden deck from DeKing Decks is something the whole family (and any Christmas ring-ins) will love. If the front or back of your house has a view, a deck will enhance your quality of life and entertaining capabilities.

And if you already have pool, a deck is the perfect compliment. There’s nothing more relaxing during the Christmas holiday season than sitting outside in the shade with a cold drink in your hand and the option of a quick dip whenever you feel like it.

The kids can play happily in the pool or backyard while under full supervision, and it will give your Christmas celebrations that great Aussie laid-back feel.

Buying yourself a deck for Christmas may be the best present you ever get! It truly is the gift that keeps on giving.

## Why Choose DeKing for your Christmas Deck?

DeKing Decks have been building world-class timber decks since 2003. We’re a local Queensland business servicing areas including Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast.

We’ve been ‘beating Santa to the punch’ for ages, delivering quality decks in time for many South East Queensland homes just in time for Christmas.

## How Much will my New Timber Deck Cost?

Don’t worry, DeKing Decks knows that Santa can’t blow all his cash on a deck for Christmas. That’s why we offer very competitive prices on all our decks and patios.

So, how much will your new timber deck cost? Well, that depends (of course) on what kind of deck you want. For example, how big it is, whether it’s on the ground floor or second floor, and what extras you’d like, such as a patio roof.

The easiest way to estimate the cost of your new deck is to use our DeKing Decks [decking calculator](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/quote-calculator/) or [patio roofing calculator](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/quote-calculator/).

Alternatively, if you’re the kind of person who likes to talk through your options, give us a call.
