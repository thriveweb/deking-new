## Enclosing a Deck

A deck is flat platform, which usually has no roof and adjoins the home. Decks are elevated from the ground and are generally made from timber or composite materials. They can be covered by a canopy or pergola, and enclosed with railings.

Enclosing a deck can mean a couple of different things.

1. To make the area more liveable you may choose to add a roof of some sort, railings, privacy screens or fly screens to keep those pesky mosquitos away. This option the deck is still open to the outside and not completely enclosed. Quite commonly called outdoor living areas because they blend the indoors and outdoors.
2. The other option is to completely enclose the outdoor deck and basically create another indoor area, possibly with an outdoor feel and more windows to see outside. To fully enclose an existing deck you will need to approach local council for consent and meet relevant building code requirements.

## Here are some enclosed deck ideas ...

Simply adding screening to a deck will enclose the area and offer more privacy for the owners. This option is still an open outside area, but screens out unwanted prying eyes and/or ugly views.

This next example shows a great outdoor dining and entertainment deck on the upper level, which has been enclosed with railings and fly screens. This designs still allows fresh air to enter and circulate the deck area, but keeps those pesky insects out. With a roof the owners also have the luxury of fans and lights for their entertainment deck.

This is another awesome example of an enclosed deck, this time utilising privacy screens, railings and a roof to enclose the deck area. Power, fans and lighting have all been included for comfort and to make the area usable day or night. What a great space!

The last example is a fully enclosed deck that weather proofs the space completely with large sliding windows.  It creates a wonderful bright living area, with great ventilation when the windows are open, and also offers the owners another inside/outside area that is protected from the weather elements totally.
