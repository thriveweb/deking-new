Timber decks won’t be complete without handrails and balustrades. These barriers assure that your family and guests are protected from accidental falls and slips. Setting them up in your decks or home interior will greatly reduce the chances for injuries to occur.

Handrails are simply the top rail that lines the upper portion of a staircase or balcony. Balustrades, on the other hand, are the upright structure that fills the area between the handrail and bottom rail. They are mostly fixed and designed to prevent unintentional falls.

In South East Queensland and other parts of the country, balustrades may come in different forms or sizes. In most cases, a specific balustrade-handrail system is always available to meet your needs.

**Here are some of the basic types of balustrade-handrail system you might consider:**

* Glass
  * A system consisting of a glass balustrade combined with handrails made either from stainless steel or timber. Most structural glass systems have lowered their prices over the years, making them more affordable for most consumers.
* Stainless steel
  * A type of balustrade-handrail system where all the components are entirely made from stainless steel. There are also other hybrid models available in the market today. For example, a stainless steel balustrade may be accompanied by handrails made from other materials like nylon or timber.
* 3kN system
  * A type of protective barrier which consists of handrails that have larger diameters and made from stainless steel. This type is most suitable for assembly buildings where handrails receive the greatest stress.

These are just some of the handrail and balustrade types which you can consider when building your home interior or timber decks.
