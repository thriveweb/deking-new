Composite decking has revolutionised outdoor living spaces with its versatility, durability, and eco-friendly properties. While it's commonly known as an excellent choice for traditional decks, its potential extends far beyond that. At Deking Decks, we're passionate about exploring the endless possibilities of this fantastic building material.

Today we'll showcase some lesser-known and innovative uses of [composite decking](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/eco-decking/), from creating a boardwalk pathway to designing unique poolside areas and more. Let's dive in and discover the creative potential of eco decks!



## What is Composite Decking, and Can It Be Used Like Regular Wood?

Composite decking is a versatile and eco-friendly alternative to traditional wood decking materials. It’s typically made from a blend of recycled wood fibres, plastic, and other materials, engineered to mimic the look and feel of natural wood while offering several advantages over traditional lumber.

The material is renowned for its durability and resistance to rot, insects, and moisture, making it an ideal choice for outdoor applications. Additionally, composite decking requires minimal maintenance compared to wood, as it does not need staining, sealing, or painting to maintain its appearance and performance.

Whether you're looking to build a deck, create custom features, or explore innovative uses for composite decking, the answer is yes—composite decking can be used like regular wood, and then some. Its durability, low-maintenance nature, and eco-friendly properties make it a preferred choice for homeowners seeking long-lasting and sustainable outdoor solutions.





## So, How Can I Use Composite Decking in Out-of-the-Box Ways?



_**1. A Boardwalk Pathway**_

Imagine strolling along a charming boardwalk winding through your garden or backyard oasis. Composite decking's durability and resistance to moisture make it an ideal material for creating sturdy and low-maintenance pathways. With its wide range of colours and textures, you can customise your boardwalk to complement the surrounding landscape, adding a touch of elegance and functionality to your outdoor space.



_**2. Seamless Bench Seating**_

Transform your deck into a cosy retreat by incorporating built-in bench seating made from composite decking. Not only does this add comfortable seating for outdoor gatherings, but it also maximises space and eliminates the need for additional furniture. Choose complementary colours and designs to seamlessly integrate benches into your deck's layout, creating a cohesive and inviting atmosphere for relaxation and entertainment.



_**3. A Poolside Entertaining Area**_

Enhance your poolside experience with a stylish and durable composite decking area. Unlike traditional materials like wood or concrete, composite decking is resistant to water damage, fading, and splintering, making it an ideal choice for pool surrounds. Create a seamless transition from your deck to the pool area, and add features like built-in seating, loungers, or a pergola to create a luxurious outdoor retreat for soaking up the sun and enjoying leisurely poolside days.



_**4. An Outdoor Kitchen or Barbecue Area**_

Elevate your outdoor entertaining game by incorporating a custom-built outdoor kitchen or barbecue area using composite decking. With its resistance to heat and moisture, composite decking provides a durable and stylish foundation for your culinary adventures. Design a functional and aesthetically pleasing space complete with countertops, storage cabinets, and seating areas, perfect for hosting family gatherings and backyard barbecues in style.



_**5. Raised Garden Beds**_

Bring sustainability and style to your garden with raised garden beds constructed from composite decking. Not only do raised beds offer ergonomic gardening solutions and improved soil drainage, but they also add visual interest and architectural flair to your outdoor space. With composite decking's longevity and resistance to rot and decay, your garden beds will remain beautiful and functional season after season, providing a vibrant backdrop for growing herbs, flowers, and vegetables.



_**6. Privacy Screens or Fencing**_

Create privacy and seclusion in your outdoor oasis with custom-designed privacy screens or fencing made from composite decking. Whether you're looking to shield your deck from prying eyes or define boundaries in your yard, composite decking offers a versatile and attractive solution. Choose from a variety of colours and styles to complement your existing decor and create a cohesive look throughout your outdoor living space.



_**7. A Safe Children's Play Area**_

Design a safe and durable play area for your little ones using composite decking. Its smooth and splinter-free surface provides a comfortable and secure environment for children to play, whether it's for a backyard playground, sandpit surround, or playhouse foundation. With composite decking's low-maintenance nature, you can spend less time worrying about upkeep and more time enjoying precious moments with your family outdoors.





_**8. A Luxurious Outdoor Shower Enclosure**_

Transform your backyard into a tropical paradise by incorporating an outdoor shower enclosure made from composite decking. Ideal for rinsing off after a refreshing swim or washing away the day's stress under the open sky, an outdoor shower adds a touch of luxury and convenience to your outdoor oasis. With composite decking's resistance to moisture and durability, your shower enclosure will withstand the elements while providing a stylish and functional addition to your outdoor space.



_**9. Vertical Gardens or Planters**_

Add a splash of greenery to your deck or patio with vertical gardens or planters constructed from composite decking. Whether you're tight on space or looking to create a striking focal point, vertical gardens offer a creative solution for incorporating plants and flowers into your outdoor decor. With composite decking's weather-resistant properties, your vertical gardens or planters will stand the test of time, providing a beautiful and sustainable way to bring nature closer to home.





_**10. Custom Deck Railing Designs**_

Elevate the aesthetics of your deck with custom railing designs crafted from composite decking. Instead of traditional wooden or metal railings, consider using composite decking boards to create unique and eye-catching railings that complement your deck's style and architecture. Whether you opt for sleek horizontal lines, intricate lattice patterns, or contemporary cable railings, composite decking offers endless possibilities for designing custom railings that add personality and charm to your outdoor space.
