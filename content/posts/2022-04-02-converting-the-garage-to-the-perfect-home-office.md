Many changes have occurred over the last couple of years with Covid-19 still causing havoc around the globe. One huge change that occurred is many work places allowing employees to work from home. Initially due to enforced lockdowns, then splitting the workforce into groups to avoid having everyone affected and having to quarantine if someone contracted Covid-19, now to being flexible to work from home if isolating.

Converting the garage to an office might just be the perfect solution to make working from home a great solution.





If you’re looking for a way to save on space and add an extra home office to your humble abode, look no further than your garage. Since garages are enclosed spaces, they can serve as ideal areas to create home office conversions.



Here’s what you’ll need to turn your car’s home into your new home office.



6 Ways to Convert a Garage Into a Home Office

1. Empty It Out

Garages can often be a one-size-fits-all dumping ground for everything from holiday decorations to paint cans you’re storing for future home improvement projects.



Before you can figure out how to convert a garage to a home office, you’ll need to figure out if it’s even possible. And that starts with clearing out the clutter!



Figure out what you have to keep and what you can get rid of. Then, find a place to store the things you need to hang on to. Consider getting an outdoor shed or installing shelves in the garage to help organize everything and keep it out of your way.



2. Survey the Space

Once you’ve cleared the clutter, survey your garage and figure out what you like and need to do for your garage to office conversion.



For example, most garages consist of a concrete floor, some sort of overhead lighting, and garage doors. For a quick and easy facelift, paint the walls a light color for a fresh, clean look. If your garage has a regular door, you can give it a quick coat of paint for a more professional look.



For more intensive projects (think: a new hardwood floor or overhead lighting that requires new outlets), you may be better off consulting with a pro.



3. Consider Comfort

Since garages are not year-round living spaces, you’ll need to ensure proper heating and cooling, so you don’t freeze during the winters and broil in the summertime.



To adapt easily (and cheaply) to the changing temperatures outside in the short-term, you can invest in a portable space heater as well as a fan and a portable air conditioner for warmer days.



Long-term, though, you’ll likely need to invest in a more permanent HVAC system to ensure the garage’s temperature stays consistent and comfortable year round.



4. Light It Up

If you’re one of the few who have windows in your garage, consider yourself lucky! But for those in a windowless room, proper lighting is a must-have. In lieu of natural lighting, make sure that your home office is outfitted with lamps not only on your desk but in other parts of your garage, too. That way, you won’t feel like you’re working in a cave with the only light source right next to you.



5. Check Your Tech

If you have an attached garage, you might think that you can rely on your Wi-Fi connection, and that might be the case. But, make sure you give your connection a solid test run before you move in. It’s one thing to do some casual browsing. It’s another to have a video meeting and multiple open tabs at the same time.



As part of learning how to convert a garage to a home office, consider that many attached garages are built with fire safety in mind, and Wi-Fi signals may have a hard time penetrating the garage walls. Depending on your situation, you may need to invest in a wired internet connection, Wi-Fi extenders, or a portable hotspot.



6. Make It Your Own

Sure, you could simply invest in an ergonomic chair and desk, but why not take the opportunity to really design a beautiful home office? Add personal touches such as throw rugs, furniture, and framed pictures.



From Thought to Reality

It’s hard to imagine what a garage turned office space could look like—especially if your garage contains nothing but cars, a lawnmower, and other assorted non-office items. Here are a few garage to office conversions to help you see what’s possible.

From Garage to Functional Home Office

Consider your new space to be a blank canvas for you to design any way that you’d like. After all, if you take the time to make the space your own, you’ll add a new dynamic to your work-from-home arrangement.







But, when you really think about it, there’s a lot of logic in doing so.



A garage is a large space, is generally underused within the home (especially if you don’t own a car or can park the car in an alternative location). It is, in fact, typically large enough to house a small business with a couple of employees, and has the added advantage of being spatially removed from the kind of home distractions that can affect your productivity,



If you work from home or you’re looking to startup a new business and want to keep the cost of having an office space down, a garage conversion could be your ideal solution.



Here’s how best to go about it.



Get council approval

If you’re looking to use the garage for business purposes, then you need to seek council approval to convert an inhabitable space into a habitable room. Many people don’t do this, and this runs certain risks for being out of regulation. This is especially so if you’re planning on having employees and clients coming and going.



Hiring a drafter to help present the plans for the space to council and organise this part of the process is a great idea to ensure things are kept running smoothly. 



2. Make the space weather proof and comfortable

Once you’ve got approvals, the next step is to guard your space against weather conditions – both for the sake of your equipment and your own comfort. Plug any wall gaps, and consider putting up drywall around the space to further insulate it. If there’s an alternative way into the garage, such as through a door leading to the house, consider locking down the main entry point and covering it with blankets or curtains.



Finally, invest in a good heater and fan, so you're equipped for all seasons. Garage spaces tend to absorb the full impact of weather extremes, and you’ll want to have control over the temperature in order to make the space comfortable in the depths of summer and winter.



3. Consider the ambience

Work spaces that have a negative vibe or ambience don’t encourage productivity, so the next step when constructing your garage office is to give the space a great atmosphere. The first thing to consider is lighting; it’s unlikely that your garage has windows, and if you’re not able to install some, you’re going to need to employ an alternative solution. The best way to do this is to print large pictures of natural scenery or other bright, warm images, and hang them around the space.



If the office will lack natural light, make sure you install effective lighting. The space should be well lit throughout, and desks should be placed close to sources of light.



4. Add extra touches to make the space more enjoyable

One of the best reasons for having your own office space is you can design it any way you want. Have a lot of clients come an visit? Some comfortable lounges for meetings could be ideal. Is the space more insular, for just  yourself and maybe your employees? Pinball machines, a Friday drinks bar space, fun posters – include whatever works well for and inspires you and your team.



Using some of the space for fun and relaxation is an excellent way to help develop the culture of your business, and something that is uniquely possible with a garage office, thanks to the large amount of available space.



5. Get the latest in technology and set it up right

Make sure you have reliable and effective technology. Many homes have wireless networks now, but often that wireless signal is weak or non-existent by the time it travels the distance to the garage. Buy additional routers or wireless signal boosters to create a stable connected environment in your new home office. Also invest in higher quality technology for data storage, computing, and printing as necessary. Wire it all together in a way that keeps the cords neat and out of the way as much as possible.



And after all that... you’ll have a perfect home office! Congratulations!
