Are you thinking of adding a patio roof to your house, but aren’t sure what kind you’d like or what is possible? No problem. We are experts at building patio roofs to suit your needs. You can customise your roof in a variety of ways with our range of patio roofing options.

Below we’ve explained your options for building a patio roof. Of course, some people choose not to have a patio roof—that is an option too—but many live to regret it. So we’ve also included some timely reminders of why getting a patio roof, of any kind, is always a good option.

## Our patio roofing styles

For most people, the first step in choosing a patio roof option is deciding on a style. This means finding a style of roof that you like and that suits your house.

At DeKing Decks, all our patio roofs are made using the **Stratco Outback** range. You can choose from the following styles:

* Outback Flat
* Outback Gable
* Outback Curved
* Outback Gazebo and Hip
* Outback Heritage Gable
* Outback Sunroof
* Outback Pergola

See pictures of all these patio roof styles on the [Stratco website](https://www.stratco.com.au/products/patios/outback).

## Our patio roofing types

Another important decision is what type of patio roof you’d like. The 2 main questions here are:

* Do you want a [Cooldek insulated](https://www.stratco.com.au/au/roofing/roofing-and-walling/cooldek-cgi-topside--smooth-underside-right-laying-50mm-thick-65mm-cutback-slate-grey-topside--off/) roof or Outback non-insulated roof?
* Do you want a [flyover style roof](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/patio-roofs/) or a fascia attached roof?

A Cooldek insulated patio roof will keep you cooler in summer, so this is a smart option. And a flyover patio roof is becoming a popular modern option. But the most important thing is to choose the right options for you.

## Why getting a patio roof is always a good option

Getting a patio roof, especially in Queensland, is always a good option. Our climate and lifestyle make outdoor living and entertaining areas a perfect addition to any home.

Here are a few key reasons why you should get a patio roof.

**Patio roofing protects your deck**

If you have a deck and want to ensure its longevity, protect it with patio roofing. A high-quality patio roof will protect your deck from the elements—such as rain and sun—as well as pollutants and dust that can settle on your deck.

[Patio roofing](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/patio-roofs/) is generally made of more durable material than the woods used in most decks, so it is more resilient when exposed to the elements.

**Use your deck all year round**

Without patio roofing you and your deck (as well as your party plans) are all subject to the weather. If it rains, too bad—no fun outside for you today. If it’s midday in summer, you and your guests will swelter under the harsh Queensland Sun.

With patio roofing you can use and enjoy your deck all year round in comfort.

**Extend the living space of your home**

Adding patio roofing allows you to take advantage of all your land by extending the living space of your home. It’s the perfect way to make your house look and feel bigger without building extra rooms.

**Protect your outdoor furniture**

Do you have a BBQ for outdoor cooking? Or perhaps you’ve just purchased a new outdoor dining set and sofas? Don’t let your outdoor furniture deteriorate—protect it with patio roofing. Of course, you could always pack and unpack your furniture into the garden shed every time you want to use it…but who wants to do that?

**Increase the value of your home**

The outdoor lifestyle is one of the major benefits of living in Queensland. A house without an outdoor living space just doesn’t feel right in this sunny state of ours.

So if you’re looking to improve the value of your home, a patio roof is a smart addition as its something that potential buyers often look for.
