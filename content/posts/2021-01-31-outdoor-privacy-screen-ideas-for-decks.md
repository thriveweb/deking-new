## What is a Privacy Screen?

It is a structure that will provide a visual barrier or screen between an outdoor area or a habitable room window on a lot and the adjoining lot.  It does not have an individual opening that is over 30 millimetres wide and the total area of openings can not exceed 30% surface area of the barrier or screen.  It could also be a window, entirely made from translucent glass and not able to be opened.

Privacy Screens can be installed for many reasons, but the most common reasons are:

* give the homeowner privacy from neighbours or people on the street, or 
* to hide unsightly views from the homeowner

There is a huge range available now of metal privacy screens.  There are some amazing design patterns available, some of them spread across multiple panels.  These panels can be mounted vertically or horizontally.
