## Can I build a deck over concrete patio?

Yes. You sure can. This is a very common request. In fact, not only can you build a deck over a concrete patio, doing so provides a moisture barrier.

That’s right—the concrete can act as a barrier between the soil and your wooden deck to prevent excess moisture exposure.

## Can you build a deck over a swimming pool?

Yes you can. And it may sound like a nifty solution, but not many people end up building a deck over their swimming pool. Instead, they often fill the pool with soil and lay down turf—because this is cheaper. But if you want a deck, we can do it!

## Can I build a deck over a septic tank?

Yes, you can do this as well. However, keep in mind that if you build a deck over a septic tank, you’ll need adequate space to access it and service it. You’ll also need space for ventilation.

## Can I build a deck over an air conditioner unit?

Indeed you can. We often build what we call ‘privacy screens’ over air conditioner units as they’re not very attractive in outdoor entertaining spaces. But just be aware that you will need enough space for servicing and ventilation.
 The same applies to pool pumps.

## Can you build a deck over pavers or tiles?

Sure, why not? You can certainly build a deck over pavers or tiles, you just need to make sure that the pavers have been laid correctly and are nicely settled. If it’s a botched DIY job, more work might need to be done before you can build a deck safely.
