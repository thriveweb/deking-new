So the deck is finished and it is now time to decorate.  What can you use to compliment that WOW factor to your newly completed deck?  This blog from [Deking Decks](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/) discusses some decorating ideas for your deck.

## Large Potted plants, Planter Boxes and Hanging Baskets

Large pots and planter boxes are a great way to add greenery to an otherwise plain deck.  There are some very nice decorative pots that are perfect to add splashes of colour to the area too.

Hanging baskets from the patio roof add another dimension to the zone, and they also add some beautiful colour and foliage.  The baskets also create movement as they sway in the breeze.  Lovely cascading colour combinations can be created with this simple decorating idea.

## Outdoor Kitchen and Dining/Entertaining Area

Incorporating an outdoor kitchen into the deck is an awesome idea.  You will be amazed just how much time you spend outdoors in this new area.  

Select furniture and accessories that compliment the home and fit the space.

## Furniture for the Pool Deck

If you have space, then definitely include some sun lounges in the pool area.  Who doesn't love lounging in the sun after a dip in the pool.  If the area is mainly in the sun, then also consider some outdoor umbrellas to give a bit of shade from the heat.

Towel hooks are another great idea to hang your towel when swimming.  If you have kids then consider a storage bin to keep the pool toys tidy.  If you are a big kid yourself then you may want to add a waterslide.

## Peace and Tranquillity

If you are looking to create a calm zone to relax and unwind, think about a waterfall or water feature.

## Colour Scheme

Try to keep the colour scheme of the deck to compliment the house.  Use similar colour tones and furnishings to complete the look of the home.
