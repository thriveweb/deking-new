## The perfect pool and surrounds

The kitchen is often said to be the heart of the home, but in Queensland (particularly during Summer) the pool is definitely where all the action is.

Pool decks look stunning and increase the value of your home, but they also have many functional benefits as well. A pool deck is the perfect place to unwind after work and keep an eye on the kids while they play in the pool. It's also a great outdoor entertainment area, an alternative outside dining area, a great party location and pre-dinner drinks area. Having a deck installed makes the pool area safer and adds to the aesthetic beauty. Wet feet are kept off the grass which will reduce the transfer of mud and debris into the home.

## Pool Decking Advantages

* If you have the room, a pool deck can offer areas for lounging, reclining, sitting, dining, entertainment, as well as a comfortable area to keep watch on the children while in the pool.
* A deck will help keep the pool cleaner, as there will be significantly less grass and dirt transfer from your feet into the pool.
* In the event of a fall, a timber deck softer than concrete or paved options, thus a more child friendly alternative.
* A pool deck that is designed well will consider the surroundings of the pool to ensure the deck compliments the whole area and should appear like a natural extension to your backyard and home.
* The addition of the roof or shaded area offers sun protection and will increase the time you can enjoy the outdoor pool deck area.
* To add something special to the pool and timber deck, you could add a wooden bridge which is constructed over the pool.
* A timber deck has a natural warmth and inviting feel.
* A deck allows better drainage of water (between the gaps in the boards), This reduces slip hazards caused by puddles of water.
* The value of your home increases when there is a good quality pool deck installed.

















## Some inspiration for your pool deck design ...

This pool area is enhanced by a lovely spotted gum deck. The black aluminium fence shows off the idyllic native bush view. The spotted gum fence posts and top rails ensure continuity. The pergola is a beautiful and functional shelter and will offer some shade from the sun while being open for good ventilation. The pergola has also been constructed using spotted gum posts to ensure all areas are tied together.









Multi level contemporary grey pool beck by DeKing Decks



Grey is all the rage in modern design right now, and this contemporary pool area takes full advantage of that, along with glass fencing panels, to give it a sleek look. The addition of multiple levels creates different niches, allowing for family groups to spend time in the same area seamlessly. Let the children splash in the pool and run around the lower portion of the deck, while the adults enjoy a drink on the raised section, complete with a large entertaining table and barbeque area. This beautiful, concealed finish, Trex decking product is a favourite of ours at DeKing Decks as it gives an uninterrupted, clean surface and is completely maintenance free, so is perfect for busy families. The beauty of this is that it can be installed around straight or round-edged pools, and also in-ground or above-ground pools, and it comes with a 25 year warranty!



Pool shade and entertaining by Deking Decks



Here is a prime example of the versatility of pool area design. Even small areas like this one can benefit immensely from the addition of a pool deck and shade structure. This classic design was formulated around the existing gorgeous stone pavers and took advantage of the view this high position provides. The durable, hardwood decking panels extend right to the pool edge, creating a seamless transition between the two areas. The wooden slats on the back of the pergola provide privacy without sacrificing ventilation, and the minimalist timber and wire cable fencing invites the natural scenery in. This pool area design creates the perfect place to take a break from swimming, host a pool party or relax and enjoy a meal with friends.
