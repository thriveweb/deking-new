## When do you want a DIY outdoor entertaining area

So you’ve decided you’d like to build an outdoor entertaining area? And perhaps you’re thinking of a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach? For basic outdoor entertaining areas, DIY can be a cheap and effective way of creating a bit of extra space.

In fact, we sell two different [DIY decking kits](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/diy-kitset-decks-patios/) to help you build your own entertaining areas. These come in set sizes and styles and are a great low-cost solution.

But if you want something to take your entertaining area to the next level, and build a space with a sense of luxury that your family and friends will adore, let us help you build it. After all, a DIY space will only ever be as good as your DIY skills.

## What kind of outdoor entertainment area would you like?

The ideal outdoor entertainment area will be different for everyone. So an important step is to decide what kind of outdoor area you would like and what kind of entertaining you’re likely to do.

If you have a pool, this tends to become the centerpiece of most outdoor entertainment areas, so you might decide you’d like some pool decking and a pool house.

Alternatively, if you don’t have a pool, your focus might be on building a deck or patio with patio roof and extending your inside entertainment area outside as far as you can.

Whatever your preference, DeKing Decks can help make this a reality.
