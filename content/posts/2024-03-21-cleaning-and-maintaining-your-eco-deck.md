## Your Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Composite Decking Fresh and Beautiful for Years to Come

**What is Composite Decking?**

Composite decking is an excellent choice for eco-conscious homeowners seeking a low-maintenance and durable alternative to traditional wood decks. Made from a blend of recycled materials, such as wood fibres and plastic, composite decking offers several advantages, including resistance to rot, insects, and warping. Additionally, composite decks are available in a wide range of colours and styles, providing endless design possibilities for your outdoor space.

**Why are Regular Cleaning and Maintenance Needed?**

While composite decking offers numerous benefits, it's essential to understand that proper maintenance is still crucial for preserving its beauty and functionality. 

_Mould and Mildew Growth:_ Although composite decking is resistant to rot, mould, and mildew can still develop on its surface, especially in damp and shaded areas. Regular cleaning helps prevent the buildup of organic matter.

Staining and Discolouration: Over time, composite decking may become susceptible to staining from spills, grease, and other substances. Without regular cleaning, these stains can become ingrained in the deck surface, detracting from its appearance. Proper maintenance ensures that your deck retains its original colour and lustre.

_Scratches and Surface Damage:_ While composite decking is highly durable, it can still sustain surface damage from heavy furniture, sharp objects, or abrasive cleaning tools. Routine maintenance, such as sweeping away debris and using furniture pads, helps minimise the risk of scratches and prolongs the life of your deck.

UV Exposure: Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause some composite decking materials to fade or become discoloured over time. While most composite decks are designed to resist UV damage, regular cleaning and the occasional application of a UV protectant sealant can help maintain the deck's colour vibrancy.

Remember, maintaining your composite deck isn't just about preserving its aesthetic appeal; it's also about protecting your investment and ensuring your outdoor space's long-term durability and functionality. Let’s discuss how you can clean and maintain your deck to keep it in top shape for years to come. 

## **Cleaning Your Composite Deck**

Regular cleaning is essential to keep your composite deck looking its best and to prevent the buildup of dirt, grime, and mould. Follow these simple steps to effectively clean your eco deck:

_**Sweep or Use a Leaf Blower:**_ Start by removing debris, leaves, and dirt from the surface of your deck using a broom or leaf blower. This prevents any abrasive particles from scratching the surface during cleaning.

**Hose Down the Deck:** Using a garden hose or pressure washer set to low pressure, rinse the deck surface thoroughly to remove any remaining debris and loose dirt.

_**Use a Mild Soap Solution:**_ Prepare a solution of warm water and mild soap or composite deck cleaner. Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach, as they can damage the surface of your deck.

**Scrub the Deck Surface:** Apply the soap solution to the deck surface and use a soft-bristled brush or mop to scrub away any stubborn stains or grime. Work in small sections and rinse immediately with water to prevent the soap from drying on the surface.

_**Rinse Thoroughly: **_Once you've scrubbed the entire deck, thoroughly rinse off the soap residue with clean water. Ensure all cleaning solution is removed to prevent any residue from attracting dirt and debris.

_**Allow to Dry: **_Allow your composite deck to air dry completely before placing furniture back or walking on the surface. Avoid using abrasive tools or harsh chemicals to speed up the drying process.

## Maintaining Your Composite Deck

In addition to regular cleaning, here are several maintenance tips to help prolong the lifespan of your eco deck:

_**Inspect Regularly:**_ Periodically inspect your composite deck for any signs of damage, such as cracks, splintering, or mould growth. Address any issues promptly to prevent further damage.

_**Prevent Stains: **_Place mats or furniture pads under outdoor furniture to prevent scratches and stains on the deck surface. Promptly clean up spills to prevent staining.

**_Avoid Sharp Objects:_** Avoid dragging sharp or heavy objects across the deck surface, as they can cause scratches and damage to the protective coating.

**_Trim Nearby Foliage:_** Keep nearby trees and plants trimmed to prevent leaves and debris from accumulating on the deck surface, leading to mould and mildew growth.

**Apply a Sealant: **While composite decking is low-maintenance, some homeowners may choose to apply a protective sealant to enhance durability and colour retention. Consult with a professional like Deking Decks for the best sealant options for your deck.

## Considerations for Brisbane's Climate

Although we’ve discussed some great general deck maintenance tips, we know that here in South East Queensland, we deal with a subtropical, coastal climate that presents its own challenges. Understanding these factors is essential for preserving the beauty and functionality of your deck. 

Brisbane experiences ample sunshine, heavy rainfall, and high humidity levels, which can accelerate deck deterioration. UV exposure can cause fading and discolouration, while moisture can lead to mould, mildew, and rot. To combat these effects, use UV protectant sealants, ensure proper drainage, and promote airflow to prevent moisture buildup.

Severe weather events, including tropical storms and cyclones, can bring high winds and flying debris that pose a risk to your deck's surface. Conduct regular inspections after storms, remove debris promptly, and repair any damage to prevent further deterioration.

Brisbane's warm and humid climate creates an ideal environment for pests like termites and ants, which could damage composite decking materials. Implement pest control measures such as termite barriers and insect-resistant decking products to protect your deck from infestations.

Coastal areas or locations near saltwater spray are susceptible to salt corrosion, which can degrade deck materials and hardware. Rinse your deck regularly with fresh water to remove salt residue, and use corrosion-resistant hardware for installation to mitigate the effects of saltwater exposure.
