The deck is designed and the build is underway ... what comes next?  You will want some amazing furniture for the deck once completed. Here at [DeKing Decks](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/) we have come up with a few ideas for different kinds of decks.

Before you rush out to buy the furniture, ask yourself the following questions:

* What type of deck am I furnishing? small deck, large entertaining deck, pool or sun deck?
* Is the deck area exposed or covered? Will the furniture be protected under a roof or exposed to the sun and storms?
* What is the purpose of the deck? Relax, entertain, cook?

## Small Deck Furniture Ideas

When you only have a small deck area, the big challenge faced is how to make the area appear larger than it really is.

The type of furniture you select for the deck can help trick the eye into thinking the area is larger than in reality.  When making the furniture selection for a small deck, try to stick with smaller pieces of furniture, which are light and simple in design.

Also consider if the deck is covered or exposed.  If exposed, try to choose furniture that will last with exposure to the weather and easy to wipe down and keep clean.

## Pool and Sun Deck Furniture Ideas

The pool deck usually has an assortment of furniture.  Depending on the size of your deck and what you are planning to use the area for you may choose to add - tables, chairs, lounges, banana beds and other pool and backyard furniture. 

The Pool/Sun Deck is a wonderful space to unwind and relax overlooking the pool.

## Entertaining Deck Furniture Ideas

Extending the living area of the home and creating a new outside entertaining area is a great idea.

If you are planning on using the area for entertaining purposes then look at installing power points, lights, fans, televisions, etc into this entertaining zone.

These areas are usually more protected from the elements, so more luxurious furniture can be used.

When done right, the entertaining deck will become the most popular room in the home.  Why stay inside when you can be outside with beautiful views, natural breezes and all the modern conveniences and comforts desired.

## Outside Dining Furniture Ideas

If there is no roof or protection, then careful thought should be given to the types of furniture used in this zone.  Pick furniture that is easy to care for and will last with exposure to the weather.
