Yes indeed, you need a permit to build a deck — certainly in Australia, anyway. As David from DeKing Decks has discovered, some Aussies would probably prefer to be able to build a deck or a patio extension on their house without needing permission. Some would even like to build a deck right up to their property fence! (Well that’s one way to get close to your neighbours!) And others want to take the DIY approach to a whole new level: ‘Especially for low-level decks, a lot of people think you can just put decking boards over the ground,’ David laughed.

A building permit is required to build a deck. Why? Well, there are some important things to consider like:

* local council planning restrictions
* the size of your block
* safety

Before Deking Decks can start building your new deck, there are a few steps that need to be followed.

## Step 1. Decide on a design idea

Even if you’ve only got a rough idea in mind for a deck you would like, [contact David at DeKing Decks](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/contact/) on **1800 335 464** and have a chat. He can help you with a concept sketch as well as decisions to do with sizing, placement and style.

## Step 2. Send the concept to a draftsman

Once you’re happy with a design concept for your deck, it’s sent off to a draftsman who draws up a site plan including elevations and perspective views.

## Step 3. Send the submission to a private certifier

When people think of getting building approvals, a lot of them still think of local councils approving plans. However, a number of years ago this responsibility was handed over to private certifiers.

Once the plans for your deck are returned to us from the draftsmen, we can send it off to a private certifier for you. And once it’s all approved, work can commence.
