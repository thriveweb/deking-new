## Garden Decking Ideas

Installing a garden deck will create a great feature for your home and garden. 

Garden decking is installed in green areas of the home and allows people to walk and also place furniture and pot plants on the deck.

Having decking in the garden areas can assist in keeping the inside of your home clean, as wet and muddy feet will walk across the deck before entering the home.  A deck can also make certain areas of the garden safer, like vegetable garden beds, cubby houses and entertainment areas.  It may be a safer option particularly in wet, damp and muddy conditions.  A deck is flat and level and will not have hazards like slippery mud or puddles present.  Non-slip coatings can also be added to the deck surface for additional safety.  Handrails can be added if required.  As well as being functional, a garden deck also enhances the appearance of the entire garden.

[DeKing Decks](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/) use only durable and resistant decking materials to withstand the harsh Queensland climate and weather conditions.

## Some inspiration for garden decks ...

Most gardens have a shed or two, but it is also common these days to have a Man Cave, a She Shed or Cubby House for the kids.  These sheds can all benefit from garden decking, either just as a front porch for the entrance or surrounding the shed.

Another garden feature growing in popularity is the Gazebo.  Adding a Gazebo will create a special place in the garden. A deck is the perfect floor type in this area, being weather resistant and strong enough to support the outdoor garden furniture and pot plants.

A deck can also be the perfect connection between the home and the garden.  This is great example of an open deck that houses outdoor furniture and railings that also double as seating and tables.  The wide open steps lead seamlessly into the garden area below.

Even small garden areas will greatly benefit with a deck.  Urban areas do not have a lot of green space available. Vertical gardens are becoming more popular.  Adding a beautiful deck to this space will create a new outdoor living area.  Whether you include vertical gardens, pot plants or a water feature the deck will look amazing.

Garden decks don't need all the bells and whistles.  With a good design you can incorporate the deck around the natural features, trees and plants in the garden.  This is an awesome example of a deck harmonising with nature, and gives the owners a very special space to sit and enjoy the peace and tranquility.
