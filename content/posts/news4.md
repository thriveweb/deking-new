Backyard summer parties are iconic in Queensland. Whether it’s a pool party, cocktail party, or something more laid-back, like a dinner party, every summer party needs a patio.

When the sun goes down and the heat dips with it, it’s party time in the sunshine state. So why not create the perfect entertaining area with a high-quality wooden deck from DeKing Decks?

## How a patio makes a party

An outdoor patio area dramatically increases your entertaining space and gives your house a relaxed flow. By building a patio in your backyard (or front yard), your indoor and outdoor area blends into one, allowing a seamless transition from [pool-side](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/pool-decking/), to lounge room, to dining table.

A patio is the ultimate mood creator—instantly putting your guests at ease, and setting the scene for a relaxed night of polite conversation or a pumping pool party where the stereo gets turned up to ten.

The combination of a pool and a patio is a classic Australian party tradition. And with very good reason: they combine to make your party guests feel cooler (whether they’re in the pool or not) and more comfortable.

Planning on feeding a bunch of family and friends? A patio provides the perfect space for an outdoor BBQ so you can interact with all your guests while cooking. It also means no more ducking out to a quiet corner of the backyard to cook by yourself. With a deck, the BBQ—and you—can be at the centre of the party.
