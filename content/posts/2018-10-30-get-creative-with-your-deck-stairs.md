When it comes to designing your [dream deck](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/) you must consider what style or size you would like your steps to be. Steps can make a huge difference to the look and feel of your deck and the overall appeal of the area.

## Four Deck Stair Ideas

**Make your stairs multi-purpose**

* You can provide extra seating by adding some comfortable seat cushions which adds colour and your own personal style.

**Add Planter Boxes**

* Ask the team at DeKing about built in timber planter boxes which can run along the edge of a set of Deck stairs. These can be planted out with some striking architecturally shaped plants which would look fabulous lit up with some strategically placed [deck lights](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/deck-accessories/). Or why not fill the flower beds with seasonal colours making a grand and attractive statement? DeKing have had many happy customers who have enjoyed adding their own flair to their outdoor Decking space.  When we revisit our clients for their Free 12 month Deck Check service,  we are always impressed with how the landscaping and the timber decking have ‘married’ together beautifully.

**Boardwalk stairs look great**

* Especially alongside some well planted garden beds. Timber boardwalk stairs create visual impact and flair. Stairs do not need to be standard, this is where you can add some creativity. Remember it is just a matter of asking your DeKing representative and we can help you come up with a great overall look.

**Choose Long Wide Steps**

DeKing can create for you a resort look and feel with long wide steps, these look great with deck lights installed. Check out DeKing’s online store as we stock [Low Voltage Deck lights](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/deck-accessories/) for sale.

The tread steps and height need to be built to the correct rise and tread dimensions. To ensure a comfortable transition when you are walking down the stairs.

Don’t be afraid to ask if we can do something different, if you have photos of a deck that you admire make sure you show us, if you have photos that you would like to email then go right ahead. Also DeKing has a [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com.au/DekingDecks/) Account so start pinning.
