## Pros of an Eco Deck

**Environmentally Friendly**

The main advantage of an eco deck is that it is made from recycled materials such as plastic bags and bottles.  Thus eco decks are environmentally friendly as they use waste products that may well otherwise end up as landfill.  Eco decking is also made from by products such as sawdust. Another environmentally friendly aspect of eco decking is that it does not require any of the finishes that wooden decks need.  The stains and preservatives finishes that are used on natural timber decks are harmful to the environment.  These are not necessary for an eco deck. A third green aspect of an eco deck is that you can use an eco friendly deck cleaner, in contrast to the environmentally harmful chemicals that are used to clean wooden decks.

**Low Maintenance**

The second biggest advantage of an eco deck is that the maintenance level is much, much less than a traditional timber deck.  An eco deck does not need to be painted, stained or oiled which is necessary for a timber deck to maintain its appearance and extend its lifetime. All the upkeep that is required to keep your eco deck clean is to hose is down with a garden hosepipe.

**Attractive**

Eco decking materials are improving all the time and are now far more attractive than the original eco deck boards that were produced.  Eco decking boards are now available in attractive colour and wood grain finishes. With an eco deck you do also do not need to use nails.  Eco deck tiles have an easy snap in place installation system which makes them easy to install and more attractive in that there are no visible nail holes or nails. Not using nails adds to the appearance of the deck and also makes them more environmentally friendly in this regard. Eco decks have a smooth and splinter free finish.

**Long Lasting and Durable**

Due to the materials that an eco deck is comprised of it won’t rot and more often than not is resistant to insect infestation.  Thus eco decking is very durable and can last 20 years or more with little to no maintenance required.

**Construction**

Eco wood is a more flexible material and provides different opportunities to that of a ‘real’ wood deck. If you have an existing timber deck that is structurally sound and level it is possible to use eco deck tiles or boards over an existing deck. You can purchase eco deck tiles which are easy to snap into place.  Thus eco decking can be an easy DIY project.

## Cons of an Eco Deck

**Eco Deck Prices**

Eco decking boards are more expensive than timber boards.  Thus the overall cost of materials for an eco deck is higher than if you chose to use timber.  For some people this is not all that important as they balance the importance of the benefits to the environment, the lack of maintenance and durability of eco decks as being more than sufficient to counteract the higher initial upfront cost that is required for materials.  For others the initial higher eco deck prices are not within their budget and a timber deck is preferred.

**
Requires Replacement Boards**

If a section of an eco deck is damaged, say scratched by furniture, you can’t sand back the eco deck like you would with a wooden deck.  If eco boards are damaged they need to be replaced.

**
Timber Decks are More Versatile**

You have more options with a timber deck.  A timber deck can be stained, oiled or painted.  Thus you can if you want completely transform your timber deck through repainting in a different colour for example.

**
Timber Decking is also be an Environmentally Friendly Option**

Timber decking too can be an environmentally friendly choice.  In fact, it is argued that the manufacturing process of eco decking is less energy efficient than the harvesting and transporting of traditional timber decking. Timber decking is also easier to dispose of than an eco deck once it reaches the end of its life.  Because of the materials that comprise an eco deck, it takes longer to decompose than the quicker rotting characteristics of wooden boards.

**Wooden Decks can also be Long Lasting**

If maintained correctly a timber deck too can be very durable and long lasting.  This is particularly true if your wooden deck has protection from the elements such as a roof over the deck.

**Not as Attractive**

Some would say, and it’s hard to argue that a well cared for timber deck has a natural beauty that eco friendly decks simply can’t match.

**DIY Timber Decks**

It is also possible to build your own deck using a timber board deck kit.  For a DIY kit for a 5m X 4m deck [Click Here](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/diy-kitset-decks-patios/).
