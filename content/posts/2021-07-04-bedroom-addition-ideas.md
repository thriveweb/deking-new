# Are you in need of more space?

There are many reasons that you may be needing more space in your home.  Do any of the following sound familiar?

* Has the family outgrown the current home?  New baby on the way?
* Is the family coming to visit?  Or a family elder moving in?
* Are your teenagers needing separate bedrooms before they kill each other?
* Do you wanting additional space to create an AirBNB? 
* Are you dreaming about a new, spacious master bedroom?

# Here are some ideas for that new bedroom addition or home extension ...

## Stand Alone Addition

Have you considered having a bedroom built as a separate building to the family house, located to the side or the rear of the block?  This option may work well for parents coming to live with you, or giving older teenagers a little more space and independence whilst still being at home.  These bedroom additions are also multifunctional, they could so be used as a home office, music room, child's play room, man-cave, she-shed, crafting room or media room, there possibilities are endless ...

## Combine Rooms

Another functional idea to create an additional bedroom for the home is to steal some space from the existing rooms in the home.  Maybe there is one large room that could be divided into two with wall?  You may have two neighbouring rooms that a builder could borrow some space from each to make a third room?  This won't increase the actual living area of the home, but it will create more rooms to suit your families needs.

## Raise the Home

This option is not available for all homes, but if you live in a Queenslander or post war home then you may be able to raise the home and build in underneath which will create a lot more floor space.  This could provide the opportunity to add in the additional bedroom, bathroom, family room, home office, laundry or storage facilities.

## Re-purpose an Existing Room/s 

If there is a room in your home that is hardly used, then you might consider changing the purpose for that room.  It might be the formal living room is not used much as the majority of the time the family use the more casual family room. What a cheap and easy way to add that additional bedroom to your home!  There may be a few small changes needed to convert the formal living room to a bedroom like the addition of a wardrobe, lighting and power points, relocation of door entries and the like.

## Rear or Side Home Extension

Building a home extension to the rear, side or front of the property is another great idea that will give you additional space in the home which could be used for those additional bedrooms.

## Garage Conversion

Converting the garage is one of the more affordable bedroom addition ideas.  If you have sufficient land, you could build another garage to replace the one that you have converted or construct a carport as a cheaper alternative.

Converting the garage will provide a significant amount of additional liveable floor space to the home. This space is not only great for bedrooms, but also another living area, home office or gym.  You could move the home office to the garage conversion and create a new bedroom in the old office space.  The ideas are endless ...

## Second Storey Addition

Another common way to add additional bedrooms is to create a second story to a home.  The second story may just be for that new master bedroom you have been dreaming of with ensuite, walk in robe, and possibly with a parent retreat as well.  

If you need a lot of extra living area you could double the floor space of the home if you added the second story over the existing floor plan of the home. 

## Master Bedroom Ideas 

Above we have discussed the bedroom addition ideas in relation to how the additional physical space for the addition or extension can be accomplished.  Below we have also included some ideas in relation to master bedrooms as these are now far more elaborate than they once were. 

It is now fairly standard for master bedroom ideas to include built in robes and access to an ensuite bathroom.  New homes now often including a master retreat which includes not only the bedroom, the ensuite, the walk in robe but also a parent only living area.  Master retreats are often planned to be as separate as possible to the rest of the home, sometimes taking up the full upstairs of the house or being a different ‘wing’ of the home. 

Contemporary master bedroom ideas can also include a free standing bathroom in the actual bedroom, making it a feature rather than a functional item. 

Really good master bedroom ideas include those that make use of clever window ideas.  These window ideas need to balance the need for privacy in our bedrooms as well as desire for natural light and ideally attractive views as well.  Who doesn’t, on the weekend, enjoy breakfast in bed whilst admiring a view?  For those who can afford it, bedrooms are no longer just functional, they are a holiday in their own right and a pleasure to be in.
