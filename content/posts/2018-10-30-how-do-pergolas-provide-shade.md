Timber Pergolas provide partial shade and add a lot of style to your backyard. A well designed Timber Pergola can also be ideally located to provide shade over an outdoor kitchen or to define the space for an outdoor family room. Other popular locations for Pergolas are over a hot tub, next to an outside Pizza Oven or close by the swimming pool. Wherever you locate it, a Timber Pergola can add a nice focal point in a garden and can help you create usable areas in your garden landscape.

From a practical point of view a Timber Pergola located on the western side of your home is the most effective location to assist in cooling your home from the hot summer sun in the afternoon.

You can increase the amount of shade provided by a Pergola in a few ways.  You may wish to have ivy, star jasmine or other vine or creeper growing over the Pergola, creating a natural plant canopy. This also makes the Pergola feel more like it’s a part of the garden.

When deciding on a climbing plant for your Timber Pergola you may want to also bear in mind that whilst shade is needed in the summer, in winter you may wish to have the softer heat and light filtering through your Pergola.  To obtain the best of both worlds, you will need then to choose a deciduous creeper which will lose its leaves in winter.  Unfortunately the dropping of leaves will mean some yard work would be required.

It may be a good idea to consult with your local garden nursery to ensure that you choose a climber that best suits your climate, the location in which you wish to plant it, the effect you wish to create and also to determine that your choice isn’t a plant that is a favourite home for spiders and other types of insects.

Another option to obtain shade from your Timber Pergola is to can add timber lattice panels. These panels also provide privacy which maybe an added bonus.  Other favoured additions to Timber Pergolas are timber fretwork to add ornate touches.

Once you have your Timber Pergola built it is then time to add great outdoor furniture and accessories.
