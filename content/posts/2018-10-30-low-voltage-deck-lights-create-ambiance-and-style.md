There are so many great reasons why you should install [Low Voltage Deck lights](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/deck-accessories/) to your new or existing deck or patio. Deck Lights can add a sense of design and interest to the overall space.

## Where should I position the lights?

**Stairs and Steps**

Low Voltage Deck Lights installed in the risers (steps) is a great option. By placing a series of lights along each riser creates a dramatic look for a wider expanse. Or place just one Deck light in the middle of each riser, which will also provide enough lighting to navigate the steps with ease.

Having deck lights can eliminate any potential problems by providing you with sufficient light to particular areas ie; stairs. Especially when you are entertaining family and friends. It will help them to navigate your decked area safely.

Deck lights can also be installed into eaves to provide soft downlight to highlight your garden beds.

This can really create some “Visual Wow” especially if you have a beautiful plant that you would like to highlight. They are also able to be installed on the horizontal creating a great uplight effect. Using Low Voltage Deck lights in different areas can totally enhance your Outdoor room creating a lovely ambiance.
