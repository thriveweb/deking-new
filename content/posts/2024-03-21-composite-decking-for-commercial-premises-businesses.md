Welcome to a luxurious option for improving commercial spaces. Imagine an al fresco dining experience under the stars, collaborative meetings bathed in natural light, or retail therapy surrounded by the great outdoors. 

A [composite deck](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/eco-decking/) can be enjoyed by staff, customers, or potential clients and business partners - it’s a win-win for any commercial space, improving the experience of everyone involved. 

Let’s explore the myriad ways decking can elevate your business and leave a lasting impression, increasing staff morale and company revenue.



## Can DeKing Decks Help Your Business by Installing an Attractive New Deck? 



**Why Composite Decking vs Other Kinds of Decks?**

Composite decking stands out for its low maintenance needs, resisting rot and decay while offering versatile aesthetics with environmentally friendly options such as the ability to be made from recycled materials. Despite a higher initial cost than wood, the long-term savings in maintenance often balance the investment. 



Meanwhile, wood decking, cherished for its timeless charm, demands regular upkeep, including staining and sealing, with sustainability concerns and a shorter lifespan. On the synthetic side, PVC decking shares low maintenance benefits with composite but may come at a higher upfront cost and limited aesthetic options.





This makes composite decking, a mix of wood and plastic, a fantastic decking material for commercial spaces, especially considering the high foot traffic and need for top-notch aesthetics. 

_The benefits of a deck for your business include:_

* An enjoyable space for customers and staff
* Increased street appeal
* Increase in property value
* Potential to increase accessibility 
* A space to incorporate branding such as colours and logos 



**Outdoor Seating for Restaurants**

A warm breeze, the aroma of delicious food, and the clinking of glasses. Decks have become a game-changer for restaurants, offering a delightful alfresco dining experience. The versatility of composite decks enables you to craft an ambience that suits your restaurant's unique character.

Elevate your outdoor seating area with composite decking, which comes in a range of styles and colours, allowing you to seamlessly integrate it into your restaurant's theme. With a deck, you can create distinct zones within your outdoor space – a cozy nook for intimate dinners, a communal area for larger groups, and even a dedicated space for live music.

Install outdoor heaters or fire pits on your composite deck to extend the al fresco dining experience throughout the year. Your patrons will appreciate the comfort and warmth of your thoughtfully designed outdoor space.



**Collaborative Spaces for Offices**

Break away from the monotony of office walls. Decks can transform your workspace, providing employees with a breath of fresh air and a dash of inspiration. 

Design elevated meeting spaces on your composite deck, offering panoramic views of the surroundings. The natural textures of composite decking add a touch of sophistication to these areas, making them conducive to brainstorming sessions and creative collaboration. A deck can impress potential clients and colleagues, leading to better business opportunities. 

You can also redefine break areas with composite decking. Comfortable and stylish furniture on a composite deck creates an inviting space for employees to recharge. To foster a rejuvenating atmosphere, incorporate planters with vibrant greenery to enhance the connection with nature.



**Attracting Customers with Retail Decks:**

Incorporating a deck into your retail space goes beyond aesthetics; it's a strategic move to enhance customer engagement, boost foot traffic, and create memorable shopping experiences. 

By curating an inviting storefront with a carefully designed deck, your retail business can leave a lasting impression on customers and stand out in a bustling landscape of storefronts.

Here are some ideas for creating a functional and attractive retail deck:

Custom Deck Branding: Explore options for branding your deck with custom graphics or signage. Make your retail space instantly recognisable, contributing to a strong brand presence that lingers in the minds of potential customers.

Seating Areas for Shoppers: Elevate the shopping experience by incorporating seating areas on the deck. Customers can take a moment to relax, enhancing their overall impression of your store. Consider adding greenery or comfortable seating options for a touch of comfort.

Evening Ambience with Lighting: Extend your retail hours into the evening by incorporating strategic lighting on the deck. Well-placed lights create an inviting ambience, making your store visible and attractive even after sunset.

Social Media-Worthy Spaces: Design your deck to be visually appealing and shareable on social media. Encourage customers to take photos and share their experiences online, turning your retail deck into a hotspot that generates organic publicity.



**Decking for Events and Entertainment:**

If your commercial space is an entertainment venue or you would like to add a venue space to a restaurant, shop or office, a composite deck might be your ideal solution. 

Decks offer a versatile platform for hosting events, from live music to outdoor performances. There is so much potential for turning your deck into a hub of social gatherings and unforgettable experiences.

_Decks offer a versatile platform for hosting events, such as: _

* Concerts and Live Performances
* Outdoor Movie Nights
* Themed Parties and Gatherings
* Vendor and Food Stalls



**How to Get Started with Your Commerical Composite Deck**

Evaluate the priorities for your project—whether it's durability, aesthetics, or budget considerations. The first place to start is deciding which materials to use. If low maintenance and eco-friendliness are high on your list, composite decking might be the perfect fit. 

Once you've defined your decking vision, find a professional to bring it to life. Seek experienced deck contractors or builders who understand the nuances of your chosen material. Ask for recommendations, explore online reviews, and request a portfolio of their previous work to ensure their expertise aligns with your expectations.

Check with your local council for any required permits or approvals. Understanding and complying with these regulations not only ensures a smooth construction process but also avoids potential legal complications down the road.

Consider your deck's intended use and the local climate when finalising the design and decorating. Are you envisioning a cozy space for intimate gatherings, or a sprawling entertainment area for larger events? Factor in aspects like shade, privacy, and accessibility to tailor the design to your unique preferences.
