Once considered a luxury outdoor ceiling fans on a deck are now recognised as a necessary and valuable addition to any outdoor living area.

## Advantages of Outdoor Ceiling Fans

![Are Outdoor Ceiling Fans Effective in Australia](/images/uploads/outdoor-ceiling-fans.jpg)

**Air Circulation**

An outdoor entertainment area becomes a cooler more comfortable place to dine or relax in the hot summer months if it has one or more outdoor ceiling fans. Even in hot and humid conditions an outdoor ceiling fan can make a substantial difference cooling your deck through air circulation.

**Repelling Mosquitoes and other Insects
**

Insects are attracted by lights on the deck at night.  However a powerful outdoor ceiling fan can help eliminate this problem for you by repelling the pesky insects as they do not like to fly in a breeze.

**An Attractive Feature**

Outdoor ceiling fans are an attractive addition to your deck providing a tropical atmosphere regardless of design. It is noted that there are some very attractive tropical designed ceiling fans available.  Unfortunately many of the tropical fans whilst looking fantastic are not as good on performance as the more traditional outdoor ceiling fans designs. When choosing a ceiling fan it is best to examine the RPM (rotations per minute) and airflow generated measured in m3hr. You may also want to examine the wattage that the fan uses as some are far more energy efficient than others.

**Costs of Outdoor Ceiling Fans**

Outdoor ceiling fans do not have to cost a fortune.  You can purchase an outdoor ceiling fan for under $400. Do be careful however to ensure that the fan you choose is designed to withstand wet or damp conditions. A cheap outdoor fan may not end up being a cost-effective purchase if it has to be replaced after a few years use should it become damaged by external weather conditions.

**Durability of Outdoor Ceiling Fans**

Most outdoor ceiling fans will deteriorate in time due to humid and wet external conditions. This is particular true in coastal regions where rust is more common due to the high concentration of salt in the air. Most outdoor ceiling fan manufacturers recommend that you undertake regular maintenance of your external fan to extend the longevity of the fan. The durability of your outdoor ceiling fan will depend also on the materials used in the construction of the fan. As stated previously some low cost outdoor fans are really not manufactured to the high degree of specification required for our fan to last many years exposed to the weather.
