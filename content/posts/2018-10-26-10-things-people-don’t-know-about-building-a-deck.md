Building a Deck in QLD? - 10 things you probably don't know. For example, do you need a permit? how big can the deck be? can I build over a swimming pool?

DeKing Decks started out in 2003 as a 1800 number—don’t worry, not _that_ kind of 1800 number—and has now grown into a world-class decking business servicing all of South East Queensland, including the Sunshine and Gold Coasts. But as David Rider explains, there’s still quite a lot that people don’t know about decks.

After working for builders in the housing sector, David found a real need for a company that specialised in timber outdoor decking, and now builds decks, patios, carports, roofing, and gazebos.

Whatever your needs, David is always up for a challenge. ‘We get all sorts of requests from decking over the top of garages to decking over the top of swimming pools that people no longer want … we’ve done a couple of them now,’ David said.

David loves meeting and talking with new clients, working out how to meet their decking needs, solving problems, and turning the job around quickly. But his biggest thrill is seeing the client’s excitement at the finished product—their brand new living space. ‘It’s not like a bathroom renovation—you always had a bathroom, so to get a new one is good, but it’s not a massive big wow! But when you build a deck on someone’s house, all of a sudden they’ve got a view and an entertaining area and a place to put a new BBQ,’ David said.

Although, creating a beautiful new living space the whole family will love isn’t quite as simple as some people think. ‘Especially for low-level decks, a lot of people think you can just put decking boards over the ground,’ David laughed.

**On that note, here are the top 10 things people don’t know or understand about building a deck:**

* **The structure**
  * All decks need a supportive frame, they don’t just hang there in mid air. Typically DeKing’s decks are built using treated pine framing timbers that have a 50-year warranty and are harvested from renewable forests. The beauty of a timber structure is that carbon is stored for life unlike a steel frame.
* **You can build a deck over a disused swimming pool**
  * Sick of pouring money into a swimming pool you barely use? DeKing Decks can build over the top of it for you!
* **Price**
  * Building a deck is a really cost-effective way of creating a new space. However, as with any kind of renovation, there are costs involved. Ring David and discuss pricing early on so you can get your budget in order. Or jump on their [online calculator](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/quote-calculator/) and get a basic estimate immediately.
* **Detail options**
  * You can choose different balustrade options including stainless steel wire, traditional federation style timber balustrade, and powder-coated aluminum.
* **Roof options**
  * You can choose from 3 different styles of roof to cover your deck/patio, including the most popular insulated style.
* **Pre-planning**
  * It’s important to get it right before work starts on your deck. ‘99% of the time a client comes to us with an idea in mind, we’ll do a quick concept sketch and make sure they like the size, change it here or there, and then from us it goes to the draftsman who draws it up including a site plan, details, elevations and perspective views,’ David said.
* **Private certifier**
  * Local councils no longer approve plans for decks; private certifier’s now do that for you. ‘Once we get the plans back from the draftsman, DeKing sends that off to the private certifier, and once it’s approved we can start work,’ David said.
* **Council planning restrictions**
  * Local councils like to make rules and, as much as you might like to, you can’t build a deck right up to the boundary of your property.
* **How big a deck should be**
  * Getting your deck the right size is important. You want something you can entertain on without it being too small or too big.
* **Block size**
  * If you’re on a limited size block, especially a small lot code, you’re only allowed to build on a percentage of that block. A lot of the time it’s 50%, sometimes less.

Deking Decks’ most popular product in Brisbane’s CBD is their [deck and patio roof combinations](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/patio-roofs/). They also offer a ‘flyover’ roof that sits above the roofline of your house and covers the deck. This creates extra space underneath the patio roof, making it cooler in summer. ‘I think a lot of people get this done rather than getting an extension on their house with a proper walled-in room. Just for cost effectiveness, you get a lot more value for your dollar,’ David said.

And once you’ve got your new deck, how do you keep it looking fabulous all-year-round? Deking Decks offer an oil treatment that will give your deck that brand-new look and feel. Some people opt to do this on an annual basis.

Although the business has grown significantly, some things have always remained the same. Twelve years on you can still call David on Deking’s original 1800 number: **1800 DeKing**, which is **1800 365 464**. David will be happy to [answer your questions](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/contact/) and help make your outdoor living dream a reality.
