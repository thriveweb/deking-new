## A flex room - what is that?

A flex room is a designated area in the home that serves different functions. It can also be called a bonus room, spare room, extra room or multi-purpose room.

A flex room doesn't have to be a spare bedroom. It could be the small room designated as an optional room, the unused space above the garage, the attic, the basement or even unused space under the stairs!

Having a flex room lets you change your home for different stages of your life, new hobbies or crafts, studying or working from home, a growing family, teenage space or having a space for elderly parents to call their own. A flex room can increase the value of your home.





## Get creative - what can you use the flex room for?



Before making the decision on what to use the flex room for, consider the space. Is it in the attic or basement? It is near a bathroom? Is is quiet enough to work or study? Is is easy access for guests? Get creative. Use colour and space saving furniture to turn this unused space into a functional room you will love.

You don't need to pick just one use for the flex room. Make it a combination room - a multi-purpose room that could be used for 2-3 different uses.  A guest room, playroom, nursery, office/study, library, music room,

Clever furniture ideas will help the transition of the flex room between multiple uses. Storage containers and furniture with hidden storage compartments can hide away the office work, toys, 

when you have visitors stay the night. An ottoman is a great place to store linen, towels, pillows and blankets for guest use. A fold out couch will save floor space during the day and fold out to a bed when you have guests use the flex room.



Nothing is stopping you from taking two or more of the ideas described above and creating a room that serves multiple purposes. Combine a yoga studio and library into a single space for meditation and reading. Set up a home office, but also use it for reading and creating. Add movie-style seating to a playroom to turn your spare bedroom into a fun-filled family theater. 





## Suggested flex room uses

**Air BnB**

Rake in a few extra bucks during the year by renting out your guest room through Airbnb. Outfit the space with essentials like towels, toiletries, and toilet paper, and make sure your home's Wi-Fi password is prominently displayed.

**Nursery**

Tuck your little one into a cozy flex room nursery. Whether the room is large or small, flex spaces are perfect for nurseries, as they can easily transition to a toddler’s room in no time. With a crib, a comfy chair, and multi-function changing table, you can truly maximize your available space for your family!

**Playroom**

Having trouble corralling all of the toys in the house? Give them their own home in a flex playroom! Kids of all ages will love to play in a colorful, unique space that’s just for them. Add furniture like small tables, easels for art projects, and big cushions or beanbag chairs. Make storing toys, books, and games easy with bookshelves and cabinets. Or use storage containers and baskets to keep them organized under tables.

Turning your spare room into your kids' playroom will let you declutter the rest of your house and keep toys under control. Have fun with the project by customizing the room to suit your children's interests and style.

**Home Office**

Turn your flex space into a home office or study so you can work from home! With bookshelves and easy-to-move furniture, you can easily organize and change the space in case you need a makeshift guest bedroom or playroom. You can even add French doors in the entryway to keep the space separate and quiet from the rest of the house. Need an office space for two? There are plenty of ways to save space with a shared office!

Guess what? No rule says that your spare room has to be able to accommodate guests. Let work be the focus of the space by turning it into a dedicated, ultra-organized, and beautiful home office.

This midcentury modern-inspired home office features bright pops of color and cleverly reimagined closet space. Roomy bookshelves and a filing cabinet provide plenty of storage, and the spacious desk offers enough room for two to work side by side.

Whether you’re a writer or an entrepreneur, having a safe space to work out your ideas is invaluable. Refashion your spare room into an office with whiteboards and plenty of empty wall space where you can map out your thoughts and get your creative juices flowing.

**Homework/Study Zone**

Doing homework at the kitchen table is so passé. Create a space where kids and teens can concentrate on their after-school projects with all the necessary tools and supplies at the ready.

Board game aficionados know that the kitchen table is often the worst place to settle in for a marathon dice-based battle—the table is cramped and often too small, and the seating is uncomfortable. When you set up a dedicated game room, you can furnish it with cozy chairs and an expansive table that can accommodate large boards. If you're an enthusiastic gamer, set up a console corner with beanbag chairs. And for a luxe touch, add a mini-fridge filled with game-night beverages.

**Living/Lounge Room**

Why have one when you can have two? Turning a bonus space into a second living room gives you the option of having both a formal living room for guests and an informal space for family time.

Looking for a place to unwind after a long day? A bonus room is the perfect spot to create your own private lounge area. This room can be used for a quiet reading area, a cozy nap space, or watching your favorite television show. Add a chaise lounge or armchair, fluffy pillows, and blankets, and let the relaxation wash over you.

**Media/Home Theatre Room**

An extra room is a great place to set up a home movie theater. Add bookshelves or floating shelves along walls to store DVDs and Blu-Rays. You can also swap out your TV for a projector to create a true big-screen home theater feel. And don’t forget about comfy furniture! Whether you go with a sectional for the whole family to share or leather armchairs for each person, good seating will make movie nights even better.

Turn that extra bedroom into a home movie theater. With a big-screen TV, ultra-comfortable seating, and a few bags of popcorn, you'll be all set to enjoy your favorite flicks. For a real cinema experience, spring for a video projector and a surround sound system.

**Bar/Entertainment Room**

A flex room is an excellent spot for a bar! Set up an island with bar stools, include plenty of storage space for spirits and glassware, and throw in a TV for catching the big game. Then, you’ll have an entertaining spot in your home that’s perfect for cocktail parties and small get-togethers.

For a flex room that puts the fun in functional, turn that bonus space into an entertainment room. A foosball or pool table provides a great centerpiece to the room while darts, billiards, and other space-saving games can be mounted on the wall. Include a flat screen TV and small wet bar, and you have a room you’ll never want to leave!

Do you love to entertain but lack the space to do it in style? Swap the traditional guest bedroom for a discreet bar and lounge space where guests can gather and mingle at your next dinner party.

**Gaming Room**

Keep video and arcade games out of the living room by creating their own separate game room! A flex game room is a great place for setting up gaming computers, video game consoles, and old-school arcade games. Don’t forget comfy loveseats, floor cushions, and bean bag chairs for those long game nights!

**Teenage Retreat**

Upgrade an open flex space into a bright and cheerful spot for older kids to hang out. Jazz up the room with colorful bean bag chairs or a long sectional couch. Not only does this bonus living room keep the kids and their friends out of the main living room, but it allows everyone to have a little privacy as well.

**Spare Bedroom**

Growing families aren’t the only ones who need additional bedroom space. Bonus rooms can easily be turned into a bedroom for a third roommate or a relative planning a long-term stay. A futon or day bed makes for a great space-saving seating area that can easily be turned into a sleeping spot for guests.

Make efficient use of an extra bedroom by combining a work space with a cozy sleep corner. For the greatest versatility, incorporate a hideaway bed and easy-to-move pieces.

Is your home short on storage space? Outfit your spare bedroom with furniture pieces that offer a variety of storage possibilities. Store linens in an antique armoire, stash rarely used tableware in a dresser, or invest in a captain's bed and stow away bulky winter clothing in the drawers.

**Hobby/Craft/Sewing Room**

When you don’t have a designated area for your hobbies, it can be difficult to focus on what you love. But with a flex room, you can build an art studio that’s just for painting, writing, yoga, crafts, and more! To create more space in your hobby room, incorporate free-standing bookshelves to store supplies. An industrial table with stools is good to have if you plan to work on long projects, too.

If crafting and creating is your jam, your maker space should reflect your imaginative personality. With smart choices of furnishings, storage accessories, and lighting, even the tiniest of rooms can become a bright and airy space for transforming ideas into reality.

A craft room need not be cluttered and uninviting—and it can still double as a guest bedroom in a pinch. The blogger at Home to Heather designed a space that's perfect for both crafts and guests by placing an eclectic creative nook next to a cozy vintage-style sleeping area. 

Even the smallest extra bedroom can give you space to express yourself artistically. Place an easel or a drafting table in a bright nook, hang shelves or bring in a cabinet for storage, and you're ready to create. If the room is big enough, you can even pull in a comfortable couch or sofa bed for overnight guests. 

Don’t feel obliged to sacrifice a corner of your bedroom or a section of a dingy basement for your sewing needs. Equip your extra room with a sewing machine, storage for notions, and a generous worktable, and you'll have a cheerful space fit for an accomplished sewist.

**Music Room**

If you’re a music aficionado, turning a flexible living space into a music room is a great idea! No matter if you play piano, drums, guitar, or another instrument, small music rooms are good for practicing, as well as storing and displaying your instrument or record collection.

Practice guitar, jam with friends, or compose your first hit song in a room dedicated to music. Lay down thick carpeting to soak up sound, and add a few comfortable floor cushions for musically inclined visitors.

**Gym/Workout/Yoga Room**

With a few free weights, a yoga mat, cardio equipment like a stationary bike or treadmill, you can create the perfect home gym that has free membership! Grab a few fans to keep the space cool, put up some mirrors on the walls, and add a bluetooth speaker for some great music. Rubber mats under cardio equipment or weights will prevent damage to floors, and you can even add a small table for equipment cleaning wipes, water bottles, candles for yoga practice, and more!

Whether you practice yoga, run, or do strength training, you'll be more motivated, better disciplined, and more excited about your workouts if you establish a dedicated exercise space. So, get moving! Drag that treadmill out of the basement or family room, and quit using it to hold dirty laundry. 

Close your eyes. Inhale. Exhale. Sure, yoga can be done anywhere you can lay down a mat, but it’s infinitely more soothing to stretch your limbs in a room devoted to relaxation. Add a small console table for Zen-inspired decor, and use a diffuser to set the mood.

**Home Library**

Do you have a book collection that you want to display? A flex room library allows you to keep all of your literary favorites in one spot. Line the walls with shelves for all your novels, magazines, and comic books, and add a few comfy chairs to read on. Bonus if the room has built-in bookshelves already installed!

Have you ever dreamed of twirling around in your own private library, surrounded by towering bookshelves, like Belle from "Beauty and the Beast"? If you don't have the square footage for a traditional living room library, your spare bedroom is the next best thing. Line the walls with shelving and save a corner for the comfiest chair you can afford.

**Walk-in Closet**

Are you running out of space for your clothes and accessories? A flexible living space can be the perfect spot for your dream walk-in closet! Install small hooks to hang your hats, scarves, and belts. Add a few floating shelves or cabinets to store purses and handbags. Set up cube storage shelves for your shoe collection. And hang some wooden rods to hold blouses, coats, dresses, and more!

If your closet is cluttered and cramped, why not migrate your clothes to a spacious new space—that underused spare room? With careful organization and a few storage accessories, you can turn your spare room into a luxurious walk-in closet.





**Gardening**

Gardening enthusiasts who lack the space or budget for a greenhouse can cultivate seedlings in their spare room from the waning days of winter through early spring. Buy ready-made shelving or DIY your own, and outfit them with light fixtures appropriate for nurturing baby plants.

**Pet Room**

You may have to evict Fido from his bedroom lair when guests arrive, but all the other days of the year, your furry friend can enjoy a private pet sanctuary. Include your pet’s favorite toys, and don’t forget to adorn the walls with dog- or cat-themed art.

**Expand the Bathroom**

Is your useless spare bedroom right next to a cramped bathroom? Think bigger! Create a spa-worthy retreat by tearing down a wall, expanding the space, and adding indulgent touches like a freestanding tub or sauna. 

**Formal Dining Room**

If a formal dining room is on your wish list but you're stuck with something less grand, think about using your spare room for  dining. All you need is a table and chairs, and some dining room-appropriate decor to transform the space.
