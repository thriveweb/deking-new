Getting a building permit for a deck in Queensland isn’t usually difficult. But it does require some careful planning and a course of action.

Unless you are a designer and a draftsperson, we recommend you work with professionals at every stage of the process. This will give you the best chance to have your building permit approved.

And as we all know, approvals processes can be costly and time-consuming. So the more you can do to make the certifier’s decision an easy one, the better.

At DeKing Decks, we can help you at every stage of the process, including getting a building permit to build a deck.

**How do I get a building permit for a deck?**

Local councils no longer approve plans and issue building permits to build decks. Instead, private certifiers now fulfil this role.

**What does a private certifier do?**

They will perform the same checks and balances that your local council used to. This is to ensure that your plans are safe and meet any local council building or planning restrictions, as well as comply with the Building Act 1975 and other standards.

If you get [DeKing Decks](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/) to build you a deck, we can send your plans to a private certifier for you.

## What should I do before applying for a building permit?

Before you apply for a building permit to build a deck, there are a number of other important steps.

**What will the deck look like?**

Firstly, you need to decide on basic things like:

* What size and shape will the deck be?
* How high off the ground will it be?

If you’re unsure about these details, [contact David at DeKing Decks](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/contact/) and have a chat. He can also help you with concept sketches and style ideas.

**Who is going to draw up a plan for you?
**

Private certifiers won’t approve any old plan for a deck. You need to get a professional draftsperson to draw up a plan for you. A draftsperson will detail all of the important factors like dimensions and elevations.

Again, we can help you with this stage of the process as we deal with draftsman all the time.
