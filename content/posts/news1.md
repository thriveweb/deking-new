There are so many ways that a [patio cover](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/patio-roofs/) can add value to a home, listed below are some of the most important ones.

## Resale value

When it comes time to sell your home, it is highly likely that your real estate agent is going to place a large focus of your advertising on your covered outdoor patio.  Not only is this likely to be a prominent photograph used in the advertising but there is nothing more that an agent likes to portray than the lifestyle that your home offers.  In most cases the cost of an outdoor patio will be more then covered in the sale of your home – never mind the years of enjoyment that it has already given you.

As far as home improvements go, a patio cover is an affordable project which returns value to you over and over.  Depending upon the materials you choose your patio should require little maintenance, last for years and years and with the right design, never date.

## Extends your living space

A patio cover can transform your home by adding an indoor, outdoor area allowing you to enjoy the benefits of ‘outdoor’ living that Australia is renowned for.  Initially after having a cover installed over your patio you are likely to feel that you are going on holiday when you step out onto the patio for a BBQ or afternoon read.  Pretty soon though your patio becomes part of your home and the extended living area gets taken for granted as it becomes one of the most frequently used parts of your home.

A patio cover can provide a shady haven for you to read a book, enjoy an alfresco meal, a UV ray free play area for the children and an excellent, relaxed entertainment area for you and your family and friends.

## Transforms the front of your house

A well designed patio can transform the front of your home.  This is particularly effective with homes that currently do not have any sort of front façade.  The addition of a patio to a plain looking home can result in a total ‘face-lift’ and make your home look not only attractive but welcoming.  Not only will you have the benefit of enjoying your ‘new’ home but this transformation will also significantly add to the resale value of your home.

## Transforms the back of your house

A patio cover over a back yard deck or tiled/concreted area will also provide your home with a ‘face-lift’.  Much is made these days of the ‘wow’ factor of a home and one of the most common of these is the addition of a covered back garden entertainment area.

## Protects your decking

If you patio is constructed of decking timbers, a cover over the timber decking will benefit you by reducing the maintenance costs of your deck and extending its longevity.

## Helps with the running costs of your home

A patio cover over say a western area of your home will help keep your house cooler during the hot summer months.  By keeping direct sunlight off your windows and exterior walls this should assist in savings through reduced power bills from air-conditioner use.

**_So, how does a patio cover add value to a home?  A patio cover is one of the most affordable and most impactful home improvements that you can do.  A patio cover will pay for itself over and over not only through your greater enjoyment of your home but also in the increased resale value of your residence._**
