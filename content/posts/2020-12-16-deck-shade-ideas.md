Once you have made the decision to build a deck, the next consideration should be what shade is required for the deck area.  Getting this overall design right for the deck and cover can be the difference between an awesome addition to the home where you want to spend your relaxation time or an expensive, regrettable decision which leads to a space that you try to avoid.

Deking Decks can help you with the design process and construct a deck with cover that is totally you! Whether you are just starting out and investigating the options or you already have a definite plan in mind, we would love to work with you to create the vision you wanting.

There are a few things to keep in mind when planning your deck and covered area.  Read through this check list and you will end up with a design that you love and it will be a great functional area to enjoy.

## Deck Design Factors

When creating your deck, be sure to consider:

* Location - the physical location of the deck will also impact other design factors (eg backyard deck, bedroom deck, entrance deck, pool deck etc)
* Size - the smaller the space generally the simpler the design, larger decks you may include seating and other features
* Purpose/Function - the purpose of the deck also plays a bit part in the design.  A pool deck may need space around the pool, an entertaining area may need a section for the BBQ and seating, there may need to be electrical and plumbing considered.
* Location of deck - consideration to blend the deck with the environment and the home.

## Deck Cover Design Factors

Factors that will influence the design of your deck cover (or patio/deck roof):

* House size -
* Land size and available space - 
* Style and age of the home - 
* Aspect of the home (direction it faces) - 
* Flat or sloping land - 
* Ground under the home - 
* 



These general factors will have some affect on the scope of your deck cover build and design, but there is plenty of room to make it your own. Deking Deck will ensure that we build a functional and beautiful deck roof that ticks all of your boxes.

## Designing the perfect deck cover

The design of your deck cover should blend perfectly with your home. It should not look out of place, but rather that it was designed at the same time as your home was originally built.  You will end up with a much better deck if you consider the design features of the home when you are planning your deck addition.

To ensure maximum enjoyment of your deck throughout the entire year, you will also want to position the deck cover so that it takes into consideration the natural sunlight and directional breezes.

If you have a timber house, you may want to consider Colorbond roofing. You can achieve a simple but effective design with a corrugated roof that will add texture and character to your house. This is usually finished with a matching balustrade or handrail on your deck to provide your outdoor entertaining area with a touch of class.



Functionality of your Patio Cover

A patio cover should also function properly. That means having adequate guttering to allow proper drainage and prevent leaks. The last thing you want is water in your roof cavity, and subsequent rot and damage, caused by a poor patio roof design.
