  This raised timber deck is awesome on so many levels.  Firstly, being a raised
  deck it gives the perfect view over the pool.  The deck also includes a pool
  house gazebo with cafe blinds that drop down to give extra protection from
  rain and wind.  The external stairs lead to the pool and the garden.


  Completely separate from the home, this outside entertaining area is perfect. 
  It is another great example of what a backyard can look like.  Create a zone
  to chill with the family, keep and eye on the kids, enjoy meals in the gazebo
  or entertain and host a party.
