  Our client at Bundamba wanted a deck to the rear of his home with 2 sets of
  steps for easy access to both sides of his property. Before the flyover roof
  could be installed the house roof had to be cut back and a new fascia and
  gutter added. Stainless steel wire rope was used for the handrail with a
  privacy screen to 1 side of the stairs.
