  This is an excellent example of how to connect an upper deck to a lower pool
  deck.  


  The large upper timber deck over looks the beautiful pool deck below. It has a
  high flyover insulated patio roof, which allows plenty of natural night and
  ventilation.  It is a wonderful outdoor area for meals and entertaining, or
  just keeping an eye on the kids in the pool below. 


  Glass pool fencing has been used on the top deck and also the pool deck to
  allow the home owners to enjoy the wonderful view of their pool and natural
  surrounds. 


  External timber steps lead you down from the top deck to the inviting pool
  area.  The pool gate is situated on the top deck so that another gate is not
  required on the lower deck.


  It looks sensational and ties in both zones to look as one.

      Hardwood decking was used for its hardwearing abilities along with an
      insulated flyover patio roof. The area was fenced off with frameless glass
      fencing
