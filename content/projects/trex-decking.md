  This high quality composite [pool
  deck](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/pool-decking/) in Kenmore is an
  example of the pool decks we complete all across Brisbane, the lower Sunshine
  Coast and Gold Coast.


  **What is Tex Composite**


  Trex is our preferred composite decking product as it gives our customers a
  maintenance free decking space which means valuable spare time is spent
  enjoying the pool area rather than maintaining it.


  Trex composite is a commercial grade composite product which comes with a 25
  year warranty in a variety of modern and traditional colours. 


  Its concealed fix finish gives an uninterrupted clean surface which speaks to
  consistency and quality in design.


  **Special Considerations**


  Decking Decks was able to tie in the colour choices of the deck with a
  contrasting border board connecting the colours in the existing house to the
  colour choice of the new decking space.

  Composite decking boards can be installed for pools irrespective of the shape
  being rounded or square edged.
