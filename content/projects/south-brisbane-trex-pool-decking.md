  The existing deck at the Silhouette Apartments was starting to deteriorate and
  needed upgrading to make it safe for the tenants of the complex. 


  Trex composite decking was chosen for its low maintenance and good looks, the
  chosen colour of "Island Mist" blended perfectly with the current contemporary
  colour scheme of the building.


  Trex decking is great for pool decking.  It has many advantages over timber.
  Trex decking will not:


  * warp, rot or splinter

  * need seasonal sealing, painting, or staining

  * stain or fade

  * become termite food


  Apart from that it looks amazing.  What a great example of a pool deck.  I am
  sure the tenants will enjoy those deck chairs by the pool with our glorious
  Queensland weather.
