  The existing deck at the Silhouette Apartments was starting to deteriorate and
  needed upgrading to make it safe for the tenants of the complex. 


  Trex composite decking was chosen for its low maintenance and good looks, the
  chosen colour of "Island Mist" blended perfectly with the current contemporary
  colour scheme of the building.
