  This is an excellent example of a caravan cover to protect the van from storms
  and damaging UV rays.


  DeKing Decks took care of all council permits to make this build hassle-free
  for the homeowners.


  Having limited space and tricky driveway angles made the design of this
  caravan cover a little more challenging than some builds.  The design chosen
  permits easy parking of the caravan.


  Screening slats were added for protection and visually they also reduce the
  height of the roof.  The slats also offer some side protection to the caravan
  during storms and offer privacy from the road frontage.


  What an awesome solution to keep the caravan safe, without having to
  compromise the look of the home.
