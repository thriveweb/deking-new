  This job involved refurbishing an existing deck to bring it back to its former
  glory.  To create this wonderful result we used all new hardwood frame and
  decking for this waterfront deck.  What an amazing boardwalk and deck for this
  business.  What better way to enhance that view than with a deck like this.

      Deking was engaged to strip the existing deck including the joists and
      rebuild to the original size. We worked closely with management to keep
      the area safe for the public during the build and do this in a very
      restricted time frame to get the area back for public use
