content: "This project at Holland Park is an example of a timber pergola / pool house. Decking Decks and Patios supply and install pergolas and pool houses all across Brisbane, the lower sunshine coast and the Gold Coast.\rPoolside structures provide a space for gathering to enjoy and appreciate the outdoor lifestyle so popular with Australian families. It can also provide a retreat where you can block out the outside world and relax in your surroundings.\rPergolas / Pool houses can be supplied in timber or steel frames with insulated or non-insulated roofing.\rInsulated roofing provides protection from heat transference and is especially useful in spaces which are not always naturally ventilated with cross breezes. It also provides options for fans, lights and even speakers to be incorporated easily. Non-insulated single skin roofing provides an economical shade structure where additional protection from heat transference is not required.\rPergolas / Pool houses are often designed to incorporate surround landscape features such as retaining walls, paving and greenery. Privacy screens are often included to create a visually protected environment when in a residential setting. Storage boxes, bars and benches are common elements often considered in outdoor entertaining spaces.\rBeing beside a pool, material selection is a critical part of the design process with consideration of steel, aluminium and timber products suitable for use near pools. Decking Decks and Patios will discuss all of the material options with you offering information around suitability and warranty to ensure a quality outcome you can enjoy."
