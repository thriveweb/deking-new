  Trex composite decking is awesome because is needs minimal maintenance.  This
  allowed our clients to keep their weekends free to enjoy the pool area, rather
  than maintaining it.


  Trex decking is great for pool decking.  It has many advantages over timber.
  Trex decking will not:


  * warp, rot or splinter

  * need seasonal sealing, painting, or staining

  * stain or fade

  * become termite food


  Apart from those benefits it also looks amazing.  Another great example of a
  pool deck.  What better way to enjoy our glorious Queensland weather.
