  This patio has created a wonderful outdoor dining/entertainment area and
  extended the living area of the home.  


  To ensure the living room of the home was not affected by the extra shade
  created by the new patio roof, the homeowners added two light boxes to the
  patio roof.  The allows plenty of natural light into the patio and also the
  living room of the home.


  This patio has an insulated roof which allow the homeowners to use this space
  all year round.  The roof not only protects against the weather and the
  scorching Queensland sun, but also keeps the area cooler and quieter with the
  insulation in the roof.  The area has been finished with lightning and fans.


  What a beautiful addition to this home.  The patio extends from the living
  room to create this outdoor area that will be used all year round.
