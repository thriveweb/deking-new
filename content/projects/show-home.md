We can transform your space with the highest quality decking products including Merbau and Australian Spotted Gum hardwoods as well as Trex© 25yr warranty composite decking.\rMerbau and Spotted gum provide a sustainable, economical decking space with an organic, natural feeling. Modern composite decking boards provide clean maintenance free spaces with concealed fixings and alternative colour options. \rDecking Decks and Patios can further complement your decking space including balustrades/ pool fencing, hardwood steps, privacy screens, storage boxes and other custom built timber structures.\rWe recommend re-oiling your deck on an annual basis to protect your timber from the harsh Australian sun and other factors which may shorten the life of your deck such as saltwater and organic waste.\r\rWe do offer a comprehensive maintenance service for our decks, which provides an industry leading 25 year Warranty. We will inspect and re-oil the deck ensuring the life of the deck is maximized and our customers can continue to enjoy their deck for years to come.\rTimber Pergolas have long been a feature of Australian properties and continue to be a desirable design feature as seen in renovation programs such as “House Rules”.
