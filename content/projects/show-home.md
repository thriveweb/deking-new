  Deking Decks and Patios designs and installs high quality decks and pergolas
  all across Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the lower Sunshine Coast. 


  **Decking Materials**


  We can transform your space with the highest quality decking products
  including Merbau and Australian Spotted Gum hardwoods as well as Trex© 25yr
  warranty composite decking.


  Merbau and Spotted gum provide a sustainable, economical decking space with an
  organic, natural feeling. Modern composite decking boards provide clean
  maintenance free spaces with concealed fixings and alternative colour
  options. 


  **Special Additions**



  Decking Decks and Patios can further complement your decking space including
  balustrades/ pool fencing, hardwood steps, privacy screens, storage boxes and
  other custom built timber structures.


  Timber Pergolas have long been a feature of Australian properties and continue
  to be a desirable design feature as seen in renovation programs such as “House
  Rules”. Decking Decks and patios specialize in painted and timber finish
  Pergolas which are often used to compliment backyard features such as
  fire-pits and outdoor living spaces.



  **Deck Maintenance**


  We recommend re-oiling your deck on an annual basis to protect your timber
  from the harsh Australian sun and other factors which may shorten the life of
  your deck such as saltwater and organic waste.


  We do offer a comprehensive maintenance service for our decks, which provides
  an industry leading 25 year Warranty. We will inspect and re-oil the deck
  ensuring the life of the deck is maximized and our customers can continue to
  enjoy their deck for years to come.
