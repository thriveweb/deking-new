  **Decking Materials Available**


  We can transform your space with the highest quality decking products
  including Merbau and Australian Spotted Gum hardwoods as well as TrexÂ© 25 year
  warranty composite decking.



  Merbau and Spotted gum provide a sustainable, economical decking space with an
  organic, natural feeling. Modern composite decking boards provide clean
  maintenance free spaces with concealed fixings and alternative colour options.



  Our decks are finished with a picture frame board providing clean lines and
  separation of areas as well as facia boards which conceal the sub-frame giving
  you the highest quality outcomes.

  Decking Decks and Patios can further complement your decking space including
  balustrades/ pool fencing, hardwood steps, privacy screens, storage boxes and
  other custom built timber structures.

  or a stylish landscaping access way, Deking Decks and Patios can provide a
