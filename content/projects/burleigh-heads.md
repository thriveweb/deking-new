  An amazing pool deck.  Integrated seating included that allows parents to
  watch over the kids in comfort, or just chill out and soak up some of our
  beautiful Queensland rays.


  This deck features extra wide decking boards to make that WOW statement.


  Love how the garden forms part of the backing for the seats and the other is
  framed by the wall.


  Great use of space tucked in the corner, but makes the deck area look huge.
