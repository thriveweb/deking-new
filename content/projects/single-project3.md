  This high-level deck has created a wonderful outdoor dining/entertainment area
  and extended the living area of the home.


  The deck has an insulated patio roof which allow the homeowners to use this
  space all year round.  The roof not only protects against the weather and the
  scorching Queensland sun, but also keeps the area cooler and quieter with the
  insulation in the roof.


  The deck is finished with traditional style balustrade and stairs to lead down
  to the front yard, all painted in colours to match the home.


  What a beautiful addition to this home. There will be many fun times to be had
  on this deck.
