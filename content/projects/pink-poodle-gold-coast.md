  This is a great example of a larger hardwood pool deck.  This deck uses larger
  hardwood decking boards with stainless steel fasteners for longevity and low
  maintenance.


  What an amazing pool deck for guests to lay back and relax and enjoy the zone
  that has been created around the pool.


  Love how the natural hardwood compliments the rock wall and water feature on
  the opposite side of the pool.   Although there is not much greenery in this
  zone, it still feels like you are escaping with nature.  What better way to
  soak up some of our beautiful Queensland rays, poolside on a natural timber
  deck.

      Commercial decking requires a slightly different approach to the design
      and build process, mainly because of the high traffic and extra demands
      placed on it due to the public not treated as their own. We at Deking
      understand what is required to make a deck last with the minium of
      maintenance for longevity while maintaining a great area for the public
