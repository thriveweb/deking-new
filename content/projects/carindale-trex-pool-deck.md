  The existing deck was well past its use by date and becoming a safety issue.
  Neal the owner contacted us to pull down the existing deck and rebuild using
  Trex composite decking because of its minimal maintenance requirements. 


  The existing aluminium pool fencing was re-installed

      So pleased with our new deck. Top job from quick quote and through the
      whole build process. Two builders with great attention to detail and left
      the site clean every day.


      Highly recommend DekingDecks.
