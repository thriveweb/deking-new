  The existing deck was well past its use by date and becoming a safety issue. 
  Neal the owner contacted us to pull down the existing deck and rebuild using
  Trex composite decking because of its minimal maintenance requirements.  The
  existing aluminium pool fencing was re-installed when the new deck was
  completed.


  [Trex decking is great for pool
  decking](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/services/pool-decking/).  It has many
  advantages over timber. Trex decking will not:


  * warp, rot or splinter

  * need seasonal sealing, painting, or staining

  * stain or fade

  * become termite food


  Apart from that it looks amazing.  What a great example of a pool deck.  I can
  imagine lying on the deck chairs with a cocktail in hand in our glorious
  Queensland weather.

      So pleased with our new deck. Top job from quick quote and through the
      whole build process. Two builders with great attention to detail and left
      the site clean every day.


      Highly recommend DekingDecks.
