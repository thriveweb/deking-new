  This amazing two level hardwood deck creates a new zone between the home and
  pool with another deck poolside.  The decks are built on quality treated pine
  frames.


  The patio area had an insulated flyover roof, which keeps the area cooler in
  summer and warmer in winter. The area can be used for numerous purposes.  


  The patio then connects to the pool area with external stairs and a pool safe
  gate.  


  The pool deck is also hardwood and looks amazing with the sparkling water and
  the plants against the rock wall under the patio deck.  It all harmonises so
  well.


  Another great example of what a backyard can look like.  Create a zone to
  chill with the family, keep and eye on the kids, enjoys meals on the back deck
  or entertain and host a party.
