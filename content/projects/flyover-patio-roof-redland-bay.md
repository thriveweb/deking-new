  This deck has created a wonderful outdoor dining/entertainment area and
  extended the living area of the home all year round.  The owners added a heat
  strip for warmth in the winter months and two fans for cooling and ventilation
  for the rest of the year.


  The deck has an insulated patio roof, which not only protects against the
  weather and the scorching Queensland sun, but also keeps the area cooler and
  quieter with the insulation in the roof.  The roof is raised above the home
  roof using extenda brackets and has been flashed with rubber dektites for a
  100% water seal. The deck is finished off with beautiful merbau posts.


  What a lovely addition to this home. An area that the family will enjoy every
  month of the year.
