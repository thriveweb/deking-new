  A beautiful example of a low level timber deck with an open style rafter
  pergola roof.  The traditional Colorbond roof with exposed timber beams
  harmonises with the warmth of the timber decking.


  The large outside area extends the living space of the home all year round and
  the roof offers protection from the elements, so even when raining you can
  have that barbecue on the back deck.


  What a lovely place to relax and chill out with the family, or entertain and
  host a party on the back pergola.
