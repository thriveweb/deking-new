  Easy access from the back pergola down some external stairs to reach a little
  piece of heaven.


  This pool house ticks all the boxes.  Starting with a lovely high Colourbond
  roof to allow plenty of air circulation this zone will not get hot even on
  Queensland Summer days.  The timber deck leads right to the inviting water's
  edge of the pool.  The timber privacy screening blocks out the neighbours
  prying eyes but still allows ventilation.


  Plenty of room and completely separate from the home, this outside
  entertaining area is perfect.  It is another great example of what a pool zone
  can look like.  Create a place to chill with the family, keep and eye on the
  kids in the pool, enjoy meals in the pergola shelter or entertain and host a
  pool party.
