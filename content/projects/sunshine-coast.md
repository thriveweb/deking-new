  This raised timber pool deck is so picturesque.  Take in the views when
  overlooking the native bush below, with peace of mind you are leaning on pool
  compliant fencing.  Enjoy protection from the weather under the pergola, or
  laze about in the Queensland sun on the beautiful timber decking that has been
  finished with an acrylic decking oil.  External stairs finish the picture with
  access to this amazing pool deck on the Sunshine Coast.


  Completely separate from the home, this outside entertaining area is perfect. 
  It is another great example of what a pool zone can look like.  Create a place
  to chill with the family, keep and eye on the kids in the pool, enjoy meals in
  the pergola shelter or entertain and host a pool party.
