  This is a great example of a deck rebuild.  The new deck includes and
  insulated patio roof, external stairs, handrail, external lighting and fans
  and oil treatment.


  The insulated patio roof makes this area more comfortable all year round -
  cooler in Summer and warmer in Winter, as well as protecting from the weather
  elements to allow outdoor entertaining at anytime.


  The stairs and handrails give easy and safe access to the backyard, and the
  timber looks great with the oil treatment. 


  Installing lighting and fans with this setup gives more options for evening
  and night time events and even on those really hot Summer days you can keep
  the air flowing.


  What a great area to relax and chill out with the family, or entertain and
  host a party on the back patio.
