  This traditional style pergola is a great example of how classic and simple
  can look amazing.


  This back pergola is built in a traditional style with a Colorbond roof and
  exposed timber beams.  At the end of the deck you will see louvred privacy
  screens.  Louvred so they can be fully closed for complete privacy or they can
  be open to allow for ventilation and lighting.  The Spotted Gum timber used in
  the decking brings a natural warmth to the outdoor area.  The external stairs
  give easy access down to the backyard.


  This zone creates another living area, and is perfect for outside
  entertaining.  It is another great example of what a pergola can look like. 
  Create a place to chill with the family, keep and eye on the kids in the
  backyard, enjoy meals on the back pergola or entertain and host a party.
