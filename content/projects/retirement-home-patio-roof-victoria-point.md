  The common pool area in this retirement home was too hot in summer for the
  residents to use.  Shade sails had been used in the past without success.  The
  area needed a new structure for shade and shelter from the harsh Queensland
  sun to allow residents the use of the pool all year round.


  An insulated flyover patio roof was the solution.  The patio roof ties in
  beautifully with the existing building and follows the roof edges to offer
  shade on multiple sides. Being insulated the area protected is also cooler. 


  The new roof looks great and will outlast any shade sails and offer better
  protection.
