  Deking Decks and Patios designs and installs carports all across Brisbane, the
  Gold Coast and the lower Sunshine Coast. 


  We can assist in designing flat / skillion carport roofs which can achieve
  wide open spans for ease of car access as well Gable carports which can
  provide a bold feature to the presentation of your property.


  **Design Considerations**


  When designing carports we are always conscious of minimizing obstructions in
  the support structure to ensure cars can be used in the space safely. This
  includes post supports as well as beam clearance for taller vehicles. 


  It is also important to consider the aesthetic of the design in complementing
  the existing faÃ§ade adding value to the property.


  Often we can include fencing, privacy screening or provide for future roller
  doors in the design.




  If you need a carport at your property, [contact Decking Decks and
  Patios](https://www.dekingdecks.com.au/contact/) for a free design
