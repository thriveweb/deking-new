  This thriving business needed to increase seating capacity to meet demand.  


  We installed this Cafe deck to tick the client's brief and also installed a
  child safe handrail to keep their patrons safe when enjoying their coffee. 
  The client's colours were used on poles and railing and a shade sail installed
  for comfort of patrons.
